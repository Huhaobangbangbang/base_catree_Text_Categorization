About this item
[ Large Top Plush Perch ] The big top perch is wrapped in plush. When the cat is bored, he can look at the scenery outside the window, the birds flying by the window or play with the toy ball below. When the kitten is tired, the cozy perch can provide enough space for the kitten to stretch or take a nap.
[ Plush Condo Playhouse ] A cat condo provides enough rest for kittens. When they become big cats, there is still plenty of room for them. Kittens can lie in a concealed warm apartment and they can also play hide-and-seek inside.
[ Sisal Scratching Posts ] The posts are covered with natural sisal. kittens can grind their claws on it to help them develop a good habit of scratching. Your expensive furniture can also be protected from damage.
[ Quality Materials ] The cat tree consists of 400g skin-friendly plush, carb-certified particle board and natural Sisal-Covered Scratching Posts. It can be a good piece of furniture to go well with your decor.
[ Reliable Stability ] Safety is always the most important. We thicken the bottom plate of the cat tree to ensure its stability. This is the perfect place for your cat to jump around.
Question:outdoor use too?
Answer:Not recommended as it is made with plush material, and it would mildew easily... If it could be in a porch that at least is clear from rain, but really more of an indoor cat tree.

Hello the answer to your question I would imagine it would aiight outside as long as it's covered like patio away from moisture rain it's furry n soft so if it was to get wet from the weather outside it would probably ruin it

Question:Is the ideal for fat cats?
Answer:My Fat cat hangs in the top shelf all day long, she isn't brave enough to climb in the little hammock part, and sometimes when she rolls over I always cringe like she is about to roll off, but she never does, she just sometimes has arms or legs hanging over the sides, but she seems to love it!
