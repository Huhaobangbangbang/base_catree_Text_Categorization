Question:Are the base dimensions really 24 x 20 on the 32"(L)X27"(W)X78"(H) model? Where do the dimensions spread out to 32 x 27 - at the very top? Thx!!
Answer:Actual measurement on mine fully assembled are 23.5x19.5. There are two shelves that extend over those measurements by 4" - 1 shelf is midway on the tree and the other is close to the top. It is solid and compact and my two 1 yr. Old cats love it. My space is limited and this size really fits well. I turn it around… see more

Question:Any owner have a small dog that is a good jumper? I'm hoping to giv my cats a place to feel safe from the energetic dog. :)
Answer:I bought this cat tower 4 years ago for this exact reason. I have a very athletic min pin mix who is leggy and can jump like a jackrabbit. She can climb the tower to the level with the little house on it. Our floors aren't even, so at that level the tower wobbles/twitches with her weight (12lbs), and she won't go highe… see more

I don't have a small dog but I do believe that this kitty tree would be great for keeping jumping doggies away from your kitties. I have model A8001 and it is awesome. It looks great and is very sturdy, its made of plywood instead of pressed wood. My kitties are big, 18 lbs each and they run and jump on it and it doesn… see more

Our dog climbs ladders but leaves this alone (he HAS put front feet on it). The cat feels safe on the two top shelves and in the house, even though the dog, at 28 lbs, can jiggle it some. We love this tower (cat, dog, and owners)!

Unless your dog is an expert climber your cats should be good

A small dog that wanted to could jump onto the lowest platform on this tree.

Question:Do the perch have a borders from all sides ?
Answer:Only a slight border with opening at one corner on each perch. Maybe half an inch high. Great for hiding small toy mouse to surprise your cat with once he climbs up.

No. Perches are flat. My daughter's cat is a large cat and she has had no incidences of falling, etc. She loves to hang her legs over the edge which of course she couldn't do if there were borders.
By Rose Throldahl on December 29, 2014
the top two perches have borders around three quarters there is a small opening to make it easier for the cat to get up there
By Stacy Bocek on December 29, 2014
Yes, all 3 of the upper perches are bordered on all sides.

Question:What is the difference between armarkat cat tree b7701 and b7801?
Answer:The B7801 has only one little kitty house and only 2 perches. My son has a 17 lb. Tabby and he won't go up on the perches. Not sure why but I think he just decided the little kitty house is high enough lol

Question:We are adopting a large breed cat, Ragamuffin,they get to be 15 - 20 pounds. Would this be large enough for a cat that size?
Answer:Hi Rob! I think it's plenty large for a 15-20 lbs cat. It's plenty tall and it's very sturdy. My husband says it's plenty sturdy, but he checks the bolts of it every few months---so you might want to do that.
The only thing we are going to do in the future is somehow anchor it to the wall because when she jumps on it, … see more

Sure! I have two 15# cats and two 7# kittens and they are all on at the same time. Very good quality and you can't beat the price.
By Macy on March 29, 2017
Definitely ! We have a large mixed breed tiger cat and he uses the tree all of the time. The Armarkat Cat tree uses plywood for the platforms. Other brands use partical board and my cat has broken them. The poles are made of a cardboard like fiber so do not allow them to get wet as they will break.

Question:My male cat is long & weighs 12 lbs; will he fit & be comfortable; Lulu female is smaller so I think she'd be ok
Answer:I have a very large Tabby cat. He is quite comfortable in his Armakat Cat Tree. He is about the size of a French Bull Dog and weighs close to 20 pounds. Enjoy.

One of my cats weighs much more than tha,t and choses to sleep in the small enclosed, box and just loves it.
By Jan Baker on June 25, 2014
None of my cats are that large, rag doll, Persian, Singapura, himie, but there is plenty of room. They all love it. Very heavy and well constructed. Not sure if this was helpful or not :-)
By wenrun on June 25, 2014
The two top platforms are 14" on each side, and my average-size girl tends to hang over a bit. If the sides were higher I'm sure she would be able to curl up just as in her cat bed, but she doesn't see the need. Hope this helps.

Question:Would this be good for cats that weigh more than 10 pounds? Easy to assemble? I'm not the most mechanically inclined :)
Answer:My cat weighs around 15 pounds so I would say it's perfect. However, I only have one cat.
It's super easy to install but I only had trouble with the little house part, it's a bit tricky.
By Romy on February 22, 2016
Hi,
This style is enough fit 60 lbs. Easy to assemble.
Thanks.
Helen,
By armarkat SELLER  on February 22, 2016
Yes I have 2 cats. One is a little overweight and she loves climbing to the top. As far as assembly, it is so easy to put together. All of the boards and pieces are lettered so just follow the directions. It comes with only one tool that's all you'll need to assemble.
By Barbara on February 21, 2016
This cat tree is very easy to assemble. My cat weighs 10lbs and loves this tree...it's very tall, and she is a tree cat.
