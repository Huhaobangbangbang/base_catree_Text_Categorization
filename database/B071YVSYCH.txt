Question:can you mount with the stairs going down either to the left or right?
Answer:Yes, you can! Our Cat Mod items are meant to be modular in this fashion. (If you are interested in a Cat Mod item that includes a vertical sisal pole then we will need to build it backward for you, as this is the only Cat Mod item that cannot be reversed at home.)
