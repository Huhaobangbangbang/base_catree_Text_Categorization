I had the same question, yes there is a lt gray but the dark gray looks blue.

I chose the light grey option. It is a plush material, not like a carpet.

Question:Before I throw it outside, how do you get S1 to bolt into C3 successfully and tightly????????? üò°üò°üò°
Answer:My husband had to revise it. They had it incorrect in the directions. I think it was something like you had to swap it either with the other one or had to flip it - there was a catch to that. Don‚Äôt throw it out - irritating as it is. Ours is great after we finally got that figured out.

Question:I am reading description that the cat upper platform is an ample 15.35 x 20.47 in. Why would the review written about it is too small for her 6 mo ?!
Answer:The platform support is 12"x19". The pillowed sides measure larger. Because it is so comfy, my cat sprawls across the top with her legs hanging off. But she loves it.
