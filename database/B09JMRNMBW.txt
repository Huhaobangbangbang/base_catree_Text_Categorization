Question:A lot of reviews make this product sound super tiny. Is it not big enough for a full grown slightly chonky kitty?
Answer:It's a great product but it was smaller than I thought. My 11 wk old kitten (3 lbs now) can clamber to the bed on top with a little struggle and it's still roomy for him in the condo. I would think adult cats could fit but maybe not the really large breeds.

It's big enough for my full grown slightly chonky kitty! He's between 14 and 16 lbs and curls up in the box part and on the top in the bed just fine! It's not a huge cat condo, but my cat likes it.

I like it but it’s not real big. My cat is about 10lbs and fits fine. It’s solid.

Saw this on my fb feed. Amazon pet ad.
There had to be a better choice.

Question:Can the top platform be on the left or right? The images show it on both sides.
Answer:YES. YES. YES. I'm saying this 3 times because of the 3 answers ahead of me that say that it cannot be mounted on both sides. The directions default to left mounting, but you will easily see that if you turn the top panel of the base box 180 degrees before screwing it in place, the platform can mount right or left. I received this 7/2/2020 and it took me all of 10 mins to put together, very straightforward. There are photos among other people's reviews from 2019-2020 that also show they were able to mount left or right. see less

No the platform is only fixed on one side. The holes are pre-drilled and you assemble according to its layout. So only 1 side.
By Amazon Customer on April 6, 2020
It's only on the left side (when facing the opening).

No it’s me to go in one one way

Question:I received my package and it has a prop65 warning for risk of exposure to formaldehyde. Any more info on this? I don’t want to open the box now
Answer:Hi, Amazon required prop 65 warning for formaldehyde. The material of our product have passed all formaldehyde test and result much lower than the standard request. It is safe for people uses.

Question:What are the dimensions of the top platform?
Answer:Not sure of the exact measurements, but its smaller than the base. My full size cat does fit on the top bed, and its pretty sturdy.
By JellyBeeney on August 8, 2020

Question:just received this but mine didn’t come with an instruction manual. How am I suppose to put it together?
Answer:It's pretty intuitive. Box, platform, post, platform.

Question:How large is the top? My cats are heavy. The one I have now top is 12 by 17 inches.
Answer:14 by 11.5"
Only our small cat uses it. Our larger ones jumped up on it once and never again because it wobbled with their weight. I'm not thrilled with it for my big cats. It's a little lopsided with the pole coming out the edge of the box.
The one positive is that it doesn't look much like a cat tree so it blends in nicely. see less
By Charissa Dufour on October 14, 2021
The top is 13” by 14”. I have two large cats and they seem to have no issues with it. Either curl up or let parts hang over the sides! They love this cat tree!
By LA on October 14, 2021
The top is 11"X14".
By anonymous on October 15, 2021
Question:Hi ! How can I get an extra cushion for the top , please ?!
Answer:If they don't sell them, shop around. Small cat beds are easy to find.
