Question:Does this have to be anchored to a wall for safety purposes if the cats are rambunctious?
Answer:Dear Customer, the bottom is reinforced and stable, but we'd like to suggest to anchored to the wall in case if there is any tipple or falls cause by sudden movement.

Dear Customer, the cat tree is stable but we'd like to suggest you to anchored to the wall for more security.
By Sweet Pet SELLER  on May 9, 2019
Yes it needs to be anchored somehow. I live in an Apartment and put a Cement mason block on the very bottom to keep it from tipping. It makes it less wobbly and the cats feel more comfortable jumping on the tree.

Question:Do you have any cat trees with real carpet?
Answer:What do you mean "real carpet"? It is covered with carpet.
By Nicki S. Aaron on November 13, 2019
I understand completely what you are saying. Carpet is much more durable than faux fur fabric. Carpet is made with a strong mesh backing that has pile woven through it. This is NOT carpet!

Question:Would this be okay for a 10 month old, 9lb kitty? Just wanted a tower that doesn't fall part easily and of course for my kitty to enjoy.
Answer:Yes, we have a couple of kitties which recently passed their 1 year mark, one of which is a bit heavy (17lbs). The smaller one jumps onto and chills on the tree all the time. It does shake sometime, but she doesn't seem to mind. The bigger one will also jump onto it from time to time, again it shakes, but he doesn't seem to mind. They are even both on it at times, on the two upper perches.

It can handle their weight and all; it won't fall apart. The only thing is that it can shake a bit. Though it may depend on the cat whether they are ok with it (as both of ours are). To be fair, most cat trees will shake a little with cats jumping up it. Most cat trees are not made of solid metal or bolted to the wall all along its height to prevent this. see less

It's very sturdy. My 4 year old kitty is 12 lbs. She loves it!! I have it free standing but you can secure it to a wall with the attachment.
By Bbxtr on March 3, 2021
Definitely! My Maine coon Max (13 lbs) and Mia (11 lbs) love this tree. They love to sit on the lower level and look out the window. They sleep, play and relax on it. It is very sturdy and has never fallen over.

Question:is this made from wood or cardboard?
Answer:I believe its particle board wood. We've had this for several months and it is very sturdy. Much more than cardboard would have been.
By A on February 21, 2020
it is made of lightweight particle board, it is not very stable, too light weight for my cats. and poorly made or cheap products, it now sits in the garage until the next garage sale.

Question:I have multiple 20+lb cats, is this sturdy/big enough for them?
Answer:It would need to be anchored to the wall for cats that big. My cat is 12 pounds and just fits inside the box. A 20 pound cat probably won't for inside.
By S Hummel on September 15, 2019
The cat tree will support cats that large but I would secure the base to a wall to prevent a leaping 20 lb. from knocking it over.
By William H. Harrington on September 11, 2019
Sturdy enough, probably. But, the platforms may be a little small for cats that big to climb/rest comfortably
By Lisa L on September 11, 2019
Not sure about all at once,my cat is small. However the base is large and stable.
By Gayle on September 11, 2019
yes
