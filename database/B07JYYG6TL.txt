Question:Anyone have 20 pound cat on this?
Answer:Yep, 23 lbs actually. Just make sure to use the provided screw hooks under the top cat beds to secure them in place. I have four of these towers, and one cat is a small whirlwind. She flew up to hit, hit it like she was playing baseball, and it broke right off. They are sturdy, but there’s always a chance! I will never buy another tower that isn’t XL HEAVY DUTY again. Even with average size cats. These are well made compared to others. see less

Question:There is no support for the baskets. Will a large cat "bend" it down?
Answer:I have a large cat and she loves the baskets. They do bend down slightly when she is in it but it's not too noticeable. She is in them daily and they are still in great condition. I have had this tree for close to a year now.

My cats are 9 1/2 and 20 pounds and they are fine on it.
By mitzis53 on October 23, 2020
The basket support it surprisingly strong, for a 15 lb cat it bends some at first, but not a lot to where the cat notices or minds & it does not break or sag more over time.
By Melissa L. Boudreaux on October 23, 2020
My cats range from 2lbs to 10lbs and we have no issues with it bending.
By Vee on October 23, 2020
Yes. I have a 12 lb Tabby and she avoids the baskets. She can’t even fit in them. The tower itself is very plush but it’s meant for small frames

Question:Does this cat tree "shed?" the one i have now sheds fibers everywhere when played on.
Answer:I dont have any shedding problems with ours. My cats did not like the height of it so I took down the top level. I'm a little disappointed because now they show no interest in it at all.

I’ve had it for three months with one cat and no not yet

The scratching posts do she'd, but that is about it. Better that, than your furniture getting ripped apart.

By BEWISHOME SELLER  on July 7, 2021
No the cushions are not removable.
By melanie on July 6, 2021
no, the cushions are attached
By Busy working mom on July 6, 2021
No they are part of the whole. It doesn’t have the stability if you remove them
By George W. Rodenbaugh II on July 6, 2021
No they are secured to the frame
By SHATT0134 on July 6, 2021
Question:Is this work for more than 10lbs cat?
Answer:I would say it might work for a cat a little bit over 10#’s. My cats are both around 10#’s and don’t fit in the round areas very good. A little deceiving on line.
By Ready2rv on July 5, 2020
Yes, It is. My cat weighs 10# and the climber is very sturdy with her.
I've been very satisfied with this purchase.
By April V. Cassidy… on July 5, 2020
Both of my cats are around 9.5 pounds and there is no problem with them on this condo.
By mitzis53 on July 5, 2020
Works for our 2 cats~10#. Pretty sturdy
By JFG on July 5, 2020
Yes it can. My cat is about 12lbs and he does good on it and the hammocks don't bend
By Jennifer A.… on July 5, 2020
Yes, two of my cats weigh 12lbs each. There is plenty of room for them to enjoy each cubby, basket & bed. The kit comes with wall mounting, I would suggest doing that as the condo is high & wobbly
