Question:dimensions for top tower level?
Answer:I gave the whole tower away. It fell over a couple of times when the cat got on the top level and cats didn't like the carpet. It was smooth and they couldn't claw it but would rather just rake through it. I had the tower about a month and donated it. Have another that we all like better.

I no longer have this tower so I can't give you an accurate measurement. It was approximately 15 x 15 or so.
By Shoes on August 4, 2013
It is 17"x12", but this unit is not very sturdy, and after a few tries, my cats quit using the top platform. When they try to jump onto that platform the entire stand moves. And when they try to jump out of it, it wobbles and usually slams back and hits the wall.

Question:what are the dimensions?
Answer:The bottom panel is 15.5"x15.5". The middle sections measure approx. 26"x22" and the top is 12"x12". About 43" in height. Although I wish the bottom was larger to "fit" the middle section (multiple cats make it a little off balance), its works for my cats. Got the navy color .... love it!! Hope this helps.

Question:where can I get directions on how to assemble a Trixie Palamos scratching post
Answer:There are directions that are included
By Amazon Customer on August 9, 2017
the directions came within the box that was shipped. Although only photos are used, just compare the pieces to the photo for the product. You are just screwing items together
it is very easy
By elaine on August 8, 2017
They should come in the box with the product.

Question:Which are the packaging measures? Thank you
Answer:Would have to check that at home tonight, but I don't know if I have the original box measurements. I don't recommend this cat scratch post. Too light weight and my cat couldn't care less for it.

I can't remember the exact measurements; it' s been a year since I bought it for my daughter. sorry.
By Shirley D. on April 29, 2014
Sorry, I don't remember for sure. The height of mine is approximately 43 inches and 37 inches wide at it's widest point, I hope that helps.
By Teresa Simerly on April 30, 2014
Can't remember the exact size of the shipping container, But assembled it only takes up a couple of square feet of floor space and stands about 42 inches high. My cat sits on top a lot and looks out the window.
By Donald E. Hesselton on April 29, 2014
the box was quite large but it's been several years since I bought it for my daughter. Some assembly was required.

Question:If I put a 50lb bag of sand at the base you think that will prevent it from falling?
Answer:I think it would help
By Robert F. on January 21, 2019
Question:How tall is this tree?
Answer:The tree is 44" tall, wich is perfect considering the size of the base. Any taller and it could possibly be a bit "wobbly" with an active cat jumping on it.
By Dick in Palm Springs on May 18, 2014
44" tall
By gailannie on May 18, 2014

By David R. Hill on May 19, 2014
43.5"
By Gordon LaPlante on May 18, 2014
Question:How Tall is it when it is put together?
Answer:It's a decent height, maybe 3ft? How ever we had to put weights in the base since it's not very stable at all.
By kat b. on February 9, 2015
It is 42" from the floor to top , And takes up about two square feet of floor space.
By Donald E. Hesselton on February 9, 2015
According to the product details it is 41 inches high. I think that is probably correct.

Question:How wide and long is the top, middle and bottom perches?
Answer:The larger perch is 15-1/2 " x 15-1/2". The smaller perches are 12" x 12". The larger perch has a 12-1/2" clearance to the next perch but you can rotate the perches to have more or less of the next perch as a roof above it. I did not set mine up like in the picture. I have the small bottom perch just outside the little cubby like a little porch. It's great that the perches can be rotated and set to your own personal preferences. It's 44" tall with a depth of 25" but the width depends on how widely you rotate and set the perches. My cat was a little intimidated by it at first. But after a month or two he was bouncing around all over it and using it completely. He loves it now and so do I. This was a terrific buy and I will order from this company again. see less
By Rob on December 27, 2014
The base is 16x16; first tier measures approx 20x20; 3 tier is 16x16 and top is 12x12. Base could be wider. Mine rests against a wall. If out in the open and your cat(s) hit at full force ... it will topple over. Hope this helps.

Question:Is the rectangular condo big enough for an adult cat?
Answer:1of my cats is overweight and don't fit, my other cat loves it. I have the condo in front of my window and they're always on it
By Julie Lopez on July 15, 2015
Yes, it should be big enough for him. Be advised that I have to put the condo in a corner of a room or it will tip over, the bottom part is not big enough.
By Brenda B. on July 15, 2015
It's not very sturdy and there was a piece missing. It looks very nice but very disappointed with the piece missing.
By sabinacabo on July 15, 2015

By Ida Murphy on July 15, 2015
No, Its flimsy and not sturdy enough for a kitten
