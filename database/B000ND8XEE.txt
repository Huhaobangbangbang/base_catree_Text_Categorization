Question:I am just needing something for my adult cats to use for an additional scratching post. Does the scratch post hold up?
Answer:This is a really great product. I have a 2 year old Norwegian forest cat (16lbs) and he breaks toys like its his job but this holds up. It's sturdy and a cheap price compared to the other posts I've bought. I would buy this again and again.

It does. I have had mine for about 6 months now. The ball came off rather quickly, but that's the case with most that have dangling toys. My cats also love to sleep inside the wedge. Out of all the cat trees and scratching posts we have, the cats favor this one the most.

My cat loves it and scratches a lot think will hold up well
By Patricia talley on June 6, 2015

By Michelle on June 5, 2015
Not quite sure if this will accommodate more than one cat. Looks bigger in picture.

Question:Trying to figure out your dimentions. Is the triangle 18"x18"x26" and the height of the 'condo' 9" and the scratching pole 27"?
Answer:the triangle is 18"X18"X25.5" THE HEIGHT IS 9" HIGH AND THE SCRATCHING POLE IS 26.5"
By Filchin56 on November 22, 2013
Very close... yes, the condo is 18x18x26", but the inside of the condo from top to bottom is only 8" on the inside, but 9" when measured from the outside. And the scratching post is REALLY only 19" including the 1" metal topper, but when screwed into the condo measures 28" from the floor.
Hope this Helps!!

The scratch post alone is 17-3/4" tall + 1" for the metal piece that swivels around with the ball on string for cat to swat at.
From floor to top of scratch post including 1" metal piece is-27 3/4".
Triangle is 18" x 18" x 26".
The 26" side is like the back of it and there is covering like the rest, but no little holes for the cat to crawl or reach through.
One 18" side has a arch entry and one hole, the other side has 4 holes (2 large/2 small).
The top of the triangle has 2 holes and a paw print on corner.
In the photo that appears to be a kitten compared to my cat is is very petite (only 8 pounds). My cat like to hide things in it and rub his paws on the rope scratch post. The metal swivel moves easy and quiet. see less

Sounds about right. Eventhough this is a well constructed condo. I myself found it to be to apsmall for afield cats. Great size for kittens. Lots of fun
By Carol y on November 22, 2013
I had this, and I'm almost positive that the pole was 27"

Question:Are there holes on all three sides of the triangle?
Answer:no. just the 2 smaller sides. it is completely carpeted on the inside and outside, and on the inside of one of the smallest holes, is a small hanging ball for them to bat at.
By Tiffany Boston on October 29, 2013
No, just on two of the three sides. the longest side has no holes.
By KellyFly on October 29, 2013
There are holes on the 2 sides and top. Not on the back side.
By Misty Battle on October 29, 2013
There are holes of 2 sides and on the top
By Alice Rock Keaton on November 1, 2013
Actually the inside of the top is not carpeted. it just wraps around from the holes on top.
By KellyFly on October 29, 2013
Question:Is this just for kittens?
Answer:We have 4 very large adult cats, and they like sitting on top of the base, but only the tiniest kittens would fit in those holes in the bottom. So the scratching post is good, but will also note we have one of the triangle points wedged between a 50 gal fish tank and the wall, which is what gives it stability, it would not hold up to our 15-20 pound cats scratching it otherwise. I note the other commenter's remark about it being torn up, we've had ours for 4 months and still holding up, but just use the scratching post part. see less

Kittens or small cats would fit thru the holes to get inside
By valann on January 20, 2015
I would say it's more for a very petite cat or kitten. If you've got a fat and or mostly average sized one it won't fit into the bottom portion. Also the scratching post part only last roughly 2-3 months for my cats. Wasn't really a good purchase for the price.
By Miranda on January 20, 2015
Pretty much. My cat is 18 months and has had it 3 months. She has grown to big, bored with it, and tore it up within 24 hours of receiving it. I repaired it several times and we both have given up on it.
By Ed on January 19, 2015
no - I would say an 8 lb cat can still get inside it. The Ball on top comes off easily though -
By Evelina Nelson on January 20, 2015
Yes.
By Tim on September 28, 2015
Question:Does the black carpet come off and go everywhere? :)
Answer:We have not had that problem :). (And we have beige carpet so it would show). The cats love the thing; the holes are too small for my maine coon but the smaller cats can get in. All use the scratching post part happily.
By Heather R. Hughes on January 31, 2016
No but the tan fibers from the scratching post come off. My cat doesn't scratch it very much she just plays with the balls and sleeps inside of it. She ripped the ball on the outside off quickly but I tied it back on and it's been on for almost a month.
By Alicia on January 31, 2016
No it doesn't it's a really cute cat house should just be noted that it's really only fit for a kitten or really small cat
By Njmoz on January 31, 2016
Not so far, I bought it about a month ago and my cat and 5 year old girl play with it.
By Sol Jeraldine on January 31, 2016
Not at all! But you will have to brush it down occasionally since it will get dirty.
By Badiea gbala on January 31, 2016
Question:Did anyone get scratches on the wall? I want to put it between the wall and a bedside table, but I'm worried about scratches on the rental walls
Answer:Depends on the cat's. I have no scratches on my walls and I have six very vivacious cats running up and down them. My cats don't scratch at walls by units, rather in corners in the hall where there is nothing there.

Question:does the back open as tunnel affect?
Answer:Yes it does. My cat absolutely loves running through it. This was a great choice for my cat.
By Deborah on September 17, 2015
Yes, but out the top of the back, behind the head.
By Carol L. Palmer on September 18, 2015
Question:I have a large 20 pound cat, would he be able to curl up and sleep inside this?
Answer:Maybe. This comes with nice cushion removable inside but it takes up a lot of room. I removed it and put a thin piece of fleece my cat likes; she has plenty of room; my cat is just under 13lbs
By Huggie on October 15, 2014
No, definitely not. My cat is only seven pounds and she barely fits. Sorry.
By LizziePea on October 15, 2014
He might but it would be a bit snug. There is a removable cushion which will give your cat more space.
By CazD on October 17, 2014
It would be a tight fit. It's a lot smaller than it appears which is why I returned it and my cat is 10pounds
By Liz on October 17, 2014
He would be pretty squished if he did fit. Our cat is around 9 lb and she loves it but it's cozy for her.

Question:Trying to determine the size/diameter of the largest hole. I have adult cats but they are on the smaller side (under 10 lbs).
Answer:I have a large Chihuahua, stands about 15 inches tall (minimum) and about 10 lbs, that could get in, turn herself around, and get back out. Has to do a bit of a shimmy to get out, but a cat her size should have no problem!
By Tiffany Boston on May 30, 2014
There is a "door type" of opening on the bottom that is about 5 inches in width at the bottom. The largest circular openings are about 4 to 4 and a half inches in diameter. My cat is an 8 pounder. She actually has never gone inside of the tree, but it has been the absolutely best scratching post we could find. Don't know if the failure to go inside is due to size or not. She does not in general go hiding at all - so it may be a temperament issue, but dont really know see less
By Alice Rock Keaton on June 2, 2014
This is really made for kittens. Now that my cats are over a year old they are to big to fit in the holes and just use it for a scratching post.
By Bubba1 on May 30, 2014
I would say that only kittens or very petite cats would comfortably fit inside the base. It's really very small and the openings are very tiny. However cats of all sizes would enjoy sticking their arms in the openings to bat around toys that are placed inside the base. The scratching post with attached ball would work for cats of all sizes. see less

Question:How do you install the toy at the top of the scratching post? The toy's flat end doesn't mate with the post's round hole.
Answer:This was a little confusing for me, too, but I figured it out. You will need a small flathead screwdriver and a hammer. There is a small black plastic sleeve on the post of the toy. Stick the metal end as far down into the hole as you can. Slide the plastic sleeve around the post into the whole. Use the flat edge of the screwdriver to firmly seat the sleeve into the hole by gently tapping it with your hammer. Do this all the way around the sleeve. You should not be able to see the sleeve once it is properly seated.
My kitten is very energetic and he pulled the toy string out of the rubber grommet end on the toy within a few weeks, I recommend that you wrap it with gorilla tape to keep it secure. I have had to do this with all his dangling toys, including feather wands, so I don't attribute it to a defect in the toy, but the fact that my kitten is very rambunctious. see less
