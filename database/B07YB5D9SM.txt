About this item
[ Cat Kingdom ] This is the cat’s own kingdom, it can do anything that it wants to do inside. The kitten can take a nap on the top plush platform or look at the scenery outside the window. Plush cat condo and basket create a perfect resting area for your cat.
[ Multi-Level Design ] We designed the cat tree into multiple levels. When the kitten is on the top platform, it can enjoy the feeling of being at the top of the world. Lively kittens can explore, play and rest in it. At the same time, kittens can also exercise climbing skills.
[ Sisal Scratching Posts ] The posts are covered with natural sisal. kittens can grind their claws on it to help them develop a good habit of scratching. Your expensive furniture can also be protected from damage.
[ Quality Materials ] The cat tree consists of 400g skin-friendly plush, carb-certified particle board and natural Sisal-Covered Scratching Posts. It can be a good piece of furniture to go well with your decor.
[ Reliable Stability ] Safety is always the most important. We thickened the bottom plate of the cat tree and added an anti-tipping device to ensure its stability. This is the perfect place for your cat to jump.
Question:What exactly has to be Attached to a wall?
Answer:Hi friend,

Thanks for asking about our product, there's a connection on the condo and can be attached to the wall with solid anchor provided by us. This can make the cat tree more stable. … see more

on the flat side of the tree...there is a strap , attach this to a stud on the wall to prevent the tree from tipping over. Some cats are heavier and the tree can easily tip when jumping up.

I didn't attach anything to the wall. It's free standing

Question:How hard is it to assemble?
Answer:It is actually quite easy to assemble. Though if your cat isn't small, you may find that it is a bit top heavy. To keep it from swaying when placed on a deep carpet, I added a wider/deeper/heavier base to the base the cat tree came with.
By Uncle M on December 3, 2020
It's not difficult at all to assemble.
By Taylor on December 3, 2020
It takes a while, but was pretty straight forward. The quality is great.
By K. Cavaliere on December 2, 2020
Wouldn’t know, it doesn’t come with instructions.

Question:Would a litter box fit on the bottom piece?
Answer:Hi friend,

Thanks for asking about our cat tree, the size of the bottom piece is 500 X 500 mm, but the height of the bottom section may be small for kittens to use the litter box, we recommend that you can place the litter box which fit the size.

Would depend on the size of the litter box and the cat. There’s 11.5” at the narrowest point between the lowest supports, and 11.5” from the base to the bottom of the next platform.
By Maggie on August 18, 2020
I wouldn’t think do. Too small of a space for the box and not tall enough for the cat to get in and do their business
By Maddie58 on August 8, 2020
No a litter box would not fit.
By Health Warrior on August 7, 2020
There’s about 14”x14” of open space at the bottom. So depending on the little box yes or no
By Jerry O Neil on August 7, 2020
No, there isn't enough height under there. Plus, that would get pretty disgusting, unless you're putting your cat condo in the bathroom.
By Rose Garcia on September 6, 2021
A small one, like a 13x9 cake pan.

Question:Would a 15lbs cat fit?
Answer:My cat is 10 lbs. and he fits in the houses, the top shelf but the bed could be bigger and he wants nothing to do with the round piece. He’s actually fallen out of the bed twice. We are going to get a bigger board and bed and replace the one that’s on there since that’s where he spends most of his time. Hope this helps you.
By LisaT on June 13, 2020
It’s doubtful. My cat is about 11-12 lbs. He fits in the boxes, mainly because the sides are fabric and stretch a bit, but it looks snug. The small perch is only large enough to to sit or stand, no lounging or laying down. The bed area is ok depending how he lays can look like he is hanging over. The hammock overflows with him when he lays in it, but it doesn’t seem to bother him. It does bend down some when he lays in it. Not sure how long that will last. You could give it a try, but I would probably look for something that could EASILY accommodate a larger cat. see less
By Lauren on January 17, 2021
It would be a tight fit. My cats are 10 to 12 pounds. They stick out of the little houses. The round hammock that hangs on the side is tiny. I had a kitten sleeping in it before he got to big. They used the cat tree for about a week. No longer interested in it.
By Health Warrior on June 13, 2020
No I'm sorry it will not work for larger cats. My cat is 12lbs and he couldn't fit in the bed.
By Taylor on June 13, 2020
It's pretty sturdy and 2 of my 4 cats are pretty large.and they all lay on and in it.
By Connie Washburn on June 13, 2020
Yes. I have two that are easily that large and they are comfortable in it.

Question:What’s the best way to clean it from urine
Answer:I use vinegar and a damp cloth. It works at keeping the cats from urinating again if you can handle the smell for a little bit.

Question:How well has it held up for your cat(s) and how long have they had it?
Answer:We've had this since early July, 2020. One of our two cats occasionally plays in it. Overall it has held up well, even though the one cat that plays in it is a bit too big for it. He has chewed the openings of the houses, but not ruined them. (I added a heavier base of 3/4 inch plywood to make it more stable  since it was on thick carpet.
 By Uncle M on February 23, 2021
I have had this for about a year and my 13 cats have not destroyed it. I purchased another one because this such a good product.
By Karl Hensel on February 23, 2021
We bought it in July and our cat plays and sleeps on it daily. It still looks like new. Very well made.
By K. Cavaliere on February 23, 2021
Have had it since Christmas, seven cats, they love it. Put catnip on it, they went crazy. Solid construction.
