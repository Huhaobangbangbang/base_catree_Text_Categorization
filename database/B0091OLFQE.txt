Question:Is the top tier suitable for a big heavy cat?
Answer:I have a 15 lb. male who is just over a year & it holds him just fine. Our other cat is a 9 lb. 10 year old female & she loves the cubby hole. They both love the second highest tier. I have it pushed against the wall in a corner. The younger cat has claws & stopped clawing the couch once I brought this in. Loves the rope to claw at. see less

I would not recommend it for a heavy cat. At first the top tier was great for my kitten, but now 7 months later he is about 8.5lbs and the top tier wobbles dangerously. There is something off about the construction of the highest pole and flipping it upside has helped some, but now the tray wobbles.

The top 2 tiers are pretty sturdy. Most of your cat's weight will be over the mounting pole. As long as your cat's not pushing 20 lbs, this cat tree should work out fine.

Our bigger cat, a 12+ lb male siamese, has claimed this scratching post, and he likes to sleep on the top tier. He mostly fits, but his paws dangle off the edges.

My cat weighs 17 pounds and he sleeps up there all the time. The little house in the middle is small but he squishes himself in there anyway
By Michele C on April 22, 2021
Yes, it is (assuming a large domestic cat, that is). Unlike most similar products this cat tree is not top-heavy; it was intelligently designed to support active cat use without toppling over.

Question:What do I need to assemble it... Is the platforms carpeted?
Answer:You will need to screw in all the columns to each base. It is very easy & the columns have a screw already in them. Everything is carpeted or covered in rope for scratching. It probably took under a half an hour to put together -- I want to say 20 minutes. I remember thinking how easy it all was.
By Dragoon on February 24, 2014
Everything you need to assemble it comes included in the box. The platforms are carpeted with a nice brown plush material.

Hi you just need a screw driver. It is carpeted. My boys love it. I'm happy with it!!
By AnnmarieF on February 23, 2014
No tools needed amd yes they are

What is the shipping size ??

Question:Some reviews claim the opening to the house is too narrow for big cats. Anyone know the diameter ? My cat is 17 lbs , want to be sure he can fit.
Answer:The box in the middle of the picture is not that big and the opening is pretty small. The opening from the steps to the box is also small. My 10 pd cat fits but doesn't stay in there. He likes the 2nd tier from the top. I think the limit to the cat tree would be 10 pounds for a cat. JMO.
By Terry S. on June 17, 2014
My full size cats won't go in it. Maybe if they were kittens they would have liked it and continued as adults. It's not very big for a 17 # cat. But depends on your cat
By Amazon Customer on August 5, 2016
He can curl up on the upper flat pieces but not the house. My boy is 16 lbs and only can use the tops, or under the house. It fits my 5lb cat much better
By Chibikittay on June 17, 2014
I forgot to add, the ladder leads up to a tiny opening in front of the house, my 16lb cat also can not use this.
By Chibikittay on June 17, 2014
The opening is about 7 inches wide.

Question:Do cats actually use that latter? It looks vertical and difficult to climb.
Answer:Cats can climb pretty much anything. My cat uses it. He loves the middle perch the most. The dangling mouse actually lasted longer than I thought. But overall very durable, def worth the buy!!
By C. Max on November 12, 2014
Yes they use it. Either to climb up, hang on, scratch on, attack. My cat loves this thing! Well worth the money.
By Julie DB on November 12, 2014
We have three cats that use the Tree and they do use the ladder on occasion, they usually just jump onto the platform though. It is a great piece of furniture for your cats, we love ours.
By Debra Crafton on November 12, 2014
Once my kitten found out how the ladder worked, it's one of his favorite parts. Sometimes he just runs up the ladder and jumps off the tree so he can run up the ladder again. I doubt older cats would find it as attractive and would probably just jump straight onto the first tier
By Kbels on December 15, 2017
My cat does use it to climb up,and its wrapped with rope and he uses it as a scratching post!
By John Parcel on November 12, 2014
Maybe a kitten would but my cats bypass the ladder

Question:I have a 17+ lb cat that's a jumper (well he tries to be). and has knocked over other cat trees. How sturdy is this?
Answer:This is very sturdy and stable. I have two 10 lb kittens and 3 baby kittens and they all use it often at the same time. It does not shake or move when they are on it! Your 17 lbs cat will be fine on this.
By Shannon Sciortino on November 27, 2014
It is stable and handles flying leaps from my 10 lb. cat. But the platforms are really not big enough for cats much larger than mine. So this unit is probably OK in terms of sturdiness, but also probably not appropriate for a larger cat.
By james d. thomas on November 28, 2014
I think it's very sturdy. We have ours on carpet. I'm not sure exactly how much our cat weighs but I would estimate it's at least 10-15 pounds. She's snatched the hanging mouse off and we have get another one of those. I've never come home and found it toppled or ever had a close scare. I would imagine if it's that gooâ€¦ see more
By L on November 27, 2014
I have this up against the wall. My 12 pound cat has made it rock once or twice but it has not toppled over. I agree with James; the platforms are only big enough for a cat curled in a small ball.

Question:How tall is the cat tree?
Answer:It is 46 inches tall.
By Kalona rheault on December 17, 2014
It tells that in the details... I do not know becuase when I saw how many parts had to be assembled, I sent it back.
By Brenda D Shrader on December 17, 2014
About 4 1/2 ft.
By Kalona rheault on December 17, 2014
4 feet
By K. J. Smith on December 17, 2014
It's just under 4 feet.
By Melanie on December 17, 2014
About 4 foot.
By Eric A Roth on December 17, 2014
Question:Is this 62 inch high or 47.5 inches -- listing says both. -- Thanks

By Donna Dougherty on November 17, 2013
The one I got was 47.5 inches.
By stella on November 17, 2013

The top tier is 47", the second tier is 37", and first tier about 21". Hope that helps.

Question:I bought one of these in the past and the rope coiling was 1/4" to 3/8"- diameter running up the poles. New ones have twine. How big is the rope now?
Answer:About the same 1/4 to 3/8 inch diameter rope on the scratching posts. Only have had it for a few weeks now but seems to be holding up pretty well to our two cats.
By RP on January 14, 2015
Not more than 1/4
