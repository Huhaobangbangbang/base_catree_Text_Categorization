Question:Can ferrets use it ?????
Answer:I could see ferrets using it. It's almost too smal for my cats so perfect for ferrets I think.

Question:What are the dimensions of the bed on top of the post to the right of the castle?
Answer:I don't know the dimensions, but my 13lb adult cat is curled up very comfortably on it for sleeping. it's right in front of the fish-tank - he loves it. Our 6mnth old kitten also sits - rather drapes herself all over - on that perch to watch the fish, but only the big cat sleeps on it by choice.

Its about 14.5" across. It fits a cat 10lbs or less.

Question:I have 2 adult cats (9 lbs. and 14 lbs.). Is this structure an apropriat size for adult cats, or only for kittens?
Answer:It's a beautiful castle although the proportions are a bit inconsistent. The tippy top of the castle part is just the perfect size for my cat (5.5 pounds) so it may possibly work for the 9 pound cat but I am doubtful for your larger cat. The side pedestal can be a wee bit flimsy but should hold either cat fine and so long as the right cushion is in the bottom part of the castle (the smaller one) your 9 pound cat will fit fine and your 14 pound cat should fit, if a bit snugly. Otherwise, the castle is very nice. see less

It turns out that it is pretty small. My sister's cats like it but they are kinda big for it. They are 10 and 16 lbs.

Best for kittens. My kitten is 6/7 lbs & starting to outgrow it. She does still use the scratching post & sits on the tower. It is adorable and if you always have kittens every few years I would buy it.

It's really designed for kittens and small cats. I got one when my kittens were small and they've continued to sleep on it throughout their growth. Now they're almost full grown and they still love to curl themselves into the bed and sleep. I wouldn't have bought it if my cats had been full grown, though.

It's actually not very large. My car weighs about 10 lbs and only fits on the top bed. It is very cute, but probably too small for two pets.
By Jamie Erickson on May 25, 2013
Question:Is this good for larger cats or only small cats and kittens???
Answer:Small cats and kittens. Our two cats are not large and they hardly fit in it anymore, but they LOVED it as kittens.
By Melissa S. Mendoza on May 16, 2014
It's definitely more for kittens. My cats are on the smaller side and they enjoy it. So unless ur cats under 9 lbs I'd pass on it. Another listing did say in the title it's for kittens.
By T. F. on May 17, 2014
Finley is about 9 pounds, very tall and lanky. He fits in the kitty castle just fine. If you have a cat much bigger than that they probably wont fit very well yet. It would be perfectbfor kittens.
By Penny N. on May 16, 2014
Mainly smaller cats... me and my friend pitched in and got this for her kitten, was a great size, but now that she's almost a year old and growing in size, she fits just okay, when she reaches a normal cat size, I think her butt will be hanging off.
By taleman2004 on May 16, 2014
Its fine for my 10 lbs cats, the 18 pounders do not fit in or on it.

Question:How tall is the bed part on the sisal post?
Answer:16 in, from floor to top bed its 29 in. After 7 months this product is my cats favorite.

About 12 inches. We have 19 rescued indoor cats and they love this. I am so glad we bought this.

It's not very big but a kitten could fit in it.

Question:I bought this not realizing it was for small cats. Can my 11 pound cat get stuck in it?
Answer:My larger cat doesn't want anything to do with this cat palace... I got it so my smaller cat had a palace all to herself. The cat probably won't get stuck, but it may just ignore it...

No, my 15lbs cat doesn't but I don't try to squeeze her into the turret.

Question:what are the measurements of the round castle top and can you get to the top of the castle from the inside of the bottom part? is the ramp sturdy?
Answer:The inside of the top castle is around a foot wide and a foot high. There is a pole that runs through it though so it's a tight space. It was perfect for my kitty. There is not an entrance from the bottom. No ramp, you might be seeing the fabric thing that just velcros on, its crinkle sounding.

Question:Do they have an equivalent of something cute like this for larger, "fat" cats? My cat is so cute and spoiled this would be perfect for her!
Answer:I'm not sure if they have a larger version...but one of our cats is relatively large (17 lbs) and she loves the lower portion of our turret. But I have read that some people felt it was too small for their cats.

Question:Can a 5 pound full size cat fit in this?
Answer:Yea! We bought it when my cat was a kitten and now she is about 7 pounds and she still uses it! It's her favorite place to sleep!
By Whitney Turner on March 25, 2017
I have a 7 pound cat who can fit in both the top and the bottom. Ive owned this for years and my four
Cats love it.
By Theresa M on March 25, 2017
Yes, no problem. My cat is twelve pounds.
By Fife on March 26, 2017
I would say yes, my kitty only went in the top section for maybe her first 6-9 months. But she practically still lives on the top perch after 2 years.
By Angela Bernard on March 24, 2017
Yes.
By mindimisfit on March 24, 2017
Question:I know it can be used for both, but do kitties usually use this more for play or for sleeping? Donâ€™t want it to be too cozy, my cat sleeps in my bed!
Answer:I think it's up to the cat, everyone is different. My cat sleeps with me as well in bed. She'll play with the castle more than sleep in it. It's rare to find her sleeping in it and if she does it's during the day for a short period of time but as stated earlier it's all up to the cat.
