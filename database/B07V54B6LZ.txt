Question:is this cat stand for large cats?
Answer:I am going to say it would be difficult for large cats with the exception of the botom opening. I got this for my kittens. They are 5 1/2 months old and they look awkward on some of the areas that I place them on as there is not as much room for them to jump from one area to the other. At 5 1/2 months, they don't really use it. My older cat was sleeping in the bottom area though. see less

Depends on what you mean by large cat, but assuming we're talking about house cats then yes. Both of my cats are pretty much fully grown (2 years old) and lay on this thing everyday.
By Sam on January 27, 2021
I would say yes, one of my cats is 17 pounds and big. He loves the little hammock and it’s still standing. The platforms on top are fairly large.

i have a 9 lb cat and a 13 lb cat. the smaller one loves this, but its harder for the bigger one to crawl around in. but it is sturdy enough. sorry for the bad punctuation. i have a cat in my lap.

No!!!! The structure is very poorly designed. The only way I could get my cats to use it, I had to take half the pieces off. The levels are too close together and we’re not accessible by the cats
By Amazon Customer on January 27, 2021
It's very sturdy. It would be great for larger domestic house cats

We consider our cat fat and it works for her she loves it. we do as well. Very nice and well made. Had a small damage issue due probably to shipping. Customer service was great and speedy.

Question:Are these posts over 3 inches like the other Feandra trees??
Answer:I think so. Both my hands together barely go around them. I've had it for a year. My cats were it out but they love it. Held up pretty good. Worth the price
