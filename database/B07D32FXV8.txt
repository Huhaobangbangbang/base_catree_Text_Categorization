Question:How big are the houses
Answer:I have a few cats ranging from 5lbs up to 20lbs-ish. The top house uses the fabric as the actual walls and the bottom uses what I assume is MDF board. All of my cats use both houses on this model. The bigger ones, when using the top ‚Äòhouse‚Äô just push the fabric out a little.

I have had a few cat trees and this is by far the best one. The 3 perches all are big enough for my largest cat to sleep on comfortably. see less

The one on the bottom is quite large. My 18 pound cat can fit no problem. The one higher up is smaller but he still uses it (only about half of him fits) but my 5 pound cat lives it. The beds are also large enough for my big cat to be comfy. All in all, it's a great tree.

Decently sized! I've got a large domestic short-hair ragdoll cross male and my brother has a large domestic short-hair Maine coon cross and they both fit in the cubbies well!
