Question:What is the height differences between perches? I have a great tree but last perch getting too high for 18 year old cat.
Answer:The lowest platform is 12.5 inches above climbing cubes - 40 inches above ground level. Highest platform is 12 inches higher - 52‚Äù above ground level. My thought is the the platforms may be a bit challenging for a Senior cat. You might might consider looking at the Vesper line of climbing structures - they offer a variety of styles that may be more user friendly and they are an equally quality product - my daughter has one for her 4 catsü§™. see less

The first box is 16 1/2‚Äù, then 11‚Äù to the top of the next box, it is 12‚Äù to the first perch, and 12‚Äù from there to the top perch. Hope this helps!

Question:Good for large cats? My cat weighs about 15 lbs and is LONG and TALL.
Answer:I‚Äôm very impressed w/unit - very sturdy and so far not necessary for me to anchored to wall. My unprofessional opinion is it is a sturdy design which will accommodate enough for the weight and height of your cat the only aspect of design for a large cat is the 2 platforms may not be long enough!

I would definitely recommend attaching it to the wall. My cats are also around 15 pounds and it has held up so far. We've had it about 3 months and my only concern is that the shelves aren't as sturdy or wide as I'd like.

It would hold the cat for sure. It is very sturdy. The smaller spaces might be a squeeze but cats can fit just about anywhere.

Only if you secure it to the wall. We tried it without securing it because we weren't sure where we were gonna keep it permanently and my 12 pound cat nearly toppled it.

Question:Would it be possible to put a litter pan in the bottom section? (My dog is gross and eats cat poop).
Answer:Yes if you built it around the pan as you constructed it. It will be a bit tough to clean out the box and replace litter tho. Good luck

Hi there.
This item is not meant to house a litter box.
The bottom "box" area does not open once built.

The bottom section is smaller than any litter box I've seen
