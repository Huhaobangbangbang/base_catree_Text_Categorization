Question:can this set be mounted linearly on a longer run over space or must it be mounte dthe way it is shown?
Answer:The Sisal Pole should be mounted vertically. However, since this is a Cat Mod product, you can mount the other items linearly if you'd like. The complex comes to you disassembled so you are able to create your own layout.

Question:Are the holes big enough for Maine Coons at full size?
Answer:The Escape Hatch hole is 8" in diameter, so most cats will have no trouble making their way through. The owners have three large cats that they use to test the furniture, and we've had many customers with big cat breeds like Maine Coons/Savannahs make use of this item without issue.
