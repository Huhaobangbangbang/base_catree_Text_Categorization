Question:Is it easy for a cat to reach all platforms? A review said her cat couldn’t get up high that it’s not made ride. Please advise.
Answer:My cats didn’t have any trouble going on any level. I guess certain cats may like to hang out on different levels. This condo definitely has a lot of options.
By Grandma Lynn on October 4, 2020
From what I'm seeing, the platforms are a little too close together.
My cats just have to go around the back of the higher condo, and then they can easily get on the perches at the top. [Almost walking around it like a spiral staircase] hope this helps

Question:Are you happy you chose this tree. Does your cats use all the levels. Is it sturdy.
Answer:Very sturdy. We have three cats and got this because we wanted them each to have their own perch. This is our second cat condo from this company and have been very happy with both purchases.

My cats love this cat tree. Multiple cats are able to cat nap on multiple levels. It also works at cat scratcher and play area.
By Thia on October 8, 2020
No. It’s very sturdy but my cats are larger and the levels do not offer enough room for them to turn around and jump to the next level

Question:Is this good for fat cats? Like 20 lbs?
Answer:The Cat litter is ok, but the size of the top platform is 13.8 x 13.8 inches.
as Asin B07S2BVWQ9, its top platform is 19.6 x 19.6 inches, which is more suitable for 20lb big cat
By Hey brother SELLER  on May 3, 2021
I would say no. I have a bigger cat and the platforms with the attachments make things hard for my cat to maneuver. Had to take a few items off.
By Brandon Tuttle on May 3, 2021
I have two large cats and it’s holding up very well. They use it to scratch on sleep on and play on well worth the money!
By Donna on May 3, 2021
If the tree is secured it should be fine. The tree is a little tall and unbalanced if left unsecured. I also removed the top level on mine to have more space at the top.

Yes small would fit not sure if you could have it there with a top though.
