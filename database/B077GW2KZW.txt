About this item
MULTI LEVEL ACTIVITY CENTER- The four level design of this PETMAKER Cat tree provides numerous levels of fun and allows your favorite feline to jump and explore the cat tower. Perfect for kittens or cats that love to climb, and for multiple cat use!
COZY LOUNGING AREAS- Cats love nothing more than to snuggle up after exercising. Each tier contains plush and comfy areas for your furry friend to peacefully relax or nap. The cat condo is an ideal cove for hiding and sleeping, while the platforms and bed/perch area lets your cat fulfill their need of sitting at a higher level and allows them to look out over their surroundings.
SCRATCH AND PLAY SPACE- The tiered cat tree has multiple scratching posts to give your cat a healthy outlet for their scratching needs, instead of using your furniture or carpet! The sisal rope scratchers on the cat tower are naturally durable and safe for your pet to use and the differing levels of the posts also help cats to stretch and tone muscle. Not only is this the perfect scratching platform, it is also ideal for playing to expend some of the energy of a younger kitten!
