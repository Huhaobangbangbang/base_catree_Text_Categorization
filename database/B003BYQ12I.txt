Question:How to clean faux fur cat tree?
Answer:I used a sudsy (Dawn detergent) sponge. I used the suds on the surface and tried not to get it overly wet. It came out pretty clean. My cat is a very dirty girl :)

It is okay to clean it using a vacuum cleaner.

Doesn't dirty easily. Just rubbing your hand across it will get anything off it. If you insist on cleaning it, just water and washcloth.

Question:What are the dimensions of the front "hole"?
Answer:The "hole" on the side is around 5 1/2 inches (circle). The front "arch way" is just under 8 1/2 inches in height and just under 7 1/2 inches in width. My cats have no problem getting in or out. They are of healthy weight, and not overweight. Hope that helps :)

8 1/2" tall by 7 1/2 " wide. It is really nice. Better for kittens than a really large cat. My kitten goes on it all day long. My 2 year old cat is very large and it is a bit too small for him. You will need to weigh it down. It is a good value for the money.

Its about 8 1/2L x 7 1/2W.

Small enough for your cat to get his head stuck and snap his neck. Do not buy this, it killed my cat.

Question:the size of top shelf ?
Answer:Yes the size of the top shelf is not large enough for adult cats period. I bought this right before Christmas 2012. At the time my cat Sophie was still a kitten. It was fine. Now that she is almost 1 year it has fallen over when she tries to jump up on top shelf. Its a shame too because that was her favorite spot to lay.

As Kerstin replied, it's just under 14" square. I have 4 cats:2 average, 1 chubby, 1 extra long....the average and the chubby both like the top shelf...and if there is too much weight, the entire tree can fall over. I solved that by placing 2 very thick books, like medical guides on the bottom shelf...haven't had any more problems. see less

We've had no issues with the top shelf in terms of fitting our robust cat (I think measurements are provided under product details). The only issue we've had is that it must be secured somehow because it can be quite wobbly (fallen over once or twice).

It's definitely not for fat cats. Only my skinny ones get up there.
