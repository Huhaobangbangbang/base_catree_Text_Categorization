Question:Hi. I have multiple cats and was wondering the weight this bridge holds? Thank you.
Answer:Be wise and not purchase anything from Plafueto, it appears they only sell krap from China where this was made. It has been two months and I still haven’t received item and Amazon is no help either.

Question:I have 3 cats, would it hold all of them?
Answer:I have two cats and it only held for a short time so I used some butterfly anchors that I bought and some screws to secure it. The ones that came with it didnt hold it very well in the wall.
