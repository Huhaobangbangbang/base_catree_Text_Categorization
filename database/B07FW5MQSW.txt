As I remember only the top piece needed to be screwed on. I'm in my 80's and it only took me 15 minutes.
By Nancy B Wilder on November 9, 2019
I never counted, but assembly was a piece of cake. Instructions are very clear and, as I recall, the only tool I needed was a screw driver.

Question:I have a energetic three month old Bengal and two grown cats that each weigh 20 pounds. Will this be safe for them?
Answer:I have 4 cats, they aren‚Äôt as energetic as a Bengal, but this cat tree has held up. I have it sitting in front of a window for them to enjoy the sun. The carpet used is not really carpet, more of a heavier fur fabric, which does ‚Äúshed‚Äù. With that being said, I do like it and so does the cats.

Question:Is this made from particleboard or wood ?
Answer:I believe it is wood. It is very durable and it is heavy. I have the taller tree for my cat. It is 6 feet tall. I think it is the best climber available. The carpeting is thick and durable and scratching posts have good rope or jute.
By Chari Jones on November 16, 2019
I cant say for sure. Those parts are covered with soft fuzzy fabric...but it seems very sturdy. I put it together...easy. Seems heavy like plywood. Very nice...good price. Too bad my cat will not use it. She prefers the sofa to sleep and claw.

Question:My cat is about 15 lbs & very long. Can anyone recommend this cat tree for bigger cats?
Answer:My cat weighs 18 pounds and is also very long - he loves it & uses it all day. It‚Äôs not too high for an elderly cat like mine to jump onto the top platform. For my old cat, it is a winner!
By BVolkle on February 13, 2019
Yes is great for your fur baby. My own is pretty fat and heavy and it's hold up her weight. It's pretty strong
