Question:Is the cat tree stable? Does it tip over?
Answer:If you have a large cat it is a little wobbly. But my cat loves his, he gets to lay in the window. No I don't think it will tip over.

Question:Does the mouse toy make a sound when being played with? How good is that rope? Would it be able to hold the weight of an adult cat?
Answer:Hello! The toy does not squeak. The rope will not stand the cat))

The mouse toy doesnt really make a sound when being played with, but my cat loved it covered in catnip! lol. My cat is about a year old, and fits perfect. But the top bed isnt that round, so a big adult cat might not fit on it as well as mine does.

The toy itself doesn't make much noise however if they get really into playing with it it will knock against the cat tree and make a tapping noise. We have it near our living room/bedrooms and it doesn't bother us. String is standard but our cats did manage to get the mouse off after a couple of months. Then we tied it up by the tail which worked for awhile they still bat the tail piece around on the tree and then play with the mouse as a toy see less

It does make a a small noise. He has actually pulled it off after a week but loves still playing with the toy since it is furry and rattles. We toss it on the top of the cat tree and he jumps to the top and fetches it.

We have 2 kittens and they managed to tear the mouse off string. They still play with it ALOT. THE MOUSE does rattle and make little sound. They love the entire stand. Been great investment for us
By amychap73 on March 17, 2017
no sound. rope is standard, but adequate. i have an 18 lb. cat and it holds him, but rocks back and forth a bit when he jumps on it.
By cbreezy on March 17, 2017
Question:Would it be sturdy enough for a 20-lb cat to have it's way with it?
Answer:In my opinion yes, the wooden box is very sturdy. I have 3 big cats and the sit on it and pounce on it trying to get out the toys. I havent had any issues.
