Question:Weight capacity of hammock?
Answer:Hi Mary,
The specs show that the max weight is 60 lbs. HOWEVER, I checked with my supplier who told me: "The holding weight refers to the weight the entire tree can handle, not any particular part, like a hammock or perch. Look at the weight in terms of cat weights. For example, a holding weight of 60 pounds can hold approx. 4 cats at 15 pounds each."
Hope this helps, but if you have any further questions, please come on back.
Stay Safe!

Question:Are the hummock and material(carpet? cushion?) inside the box detachable / washable??
Answer:Hi,
The hammock is not detachable and we would recommend spot clean for it.
For the condo's inner padding, it is detachable and washable.
