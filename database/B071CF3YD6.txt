Question:In the questions it mentions drilling into ceiling or wall, but the photos show a pressure type system with no drilling, is drilling a hole required?
Answer:The tree itself has a threaded rod that inserts into the end cap so that you can adjust the length and use pressure against the ceiling. It also comes with a couple of brackets that can be mounted onto the tree to anchor it to the wall with screws. I highly recommend using the brackets if you can. I didn't use them and the tree nearly fell on my head...with all three cats fast asleep in the hammocks. They weren't pleased about the sudden interruption of their naps, and I was reminded of a certain nursery rhyme involving a cradle in a tree. LOL I hope this helps. :-) see less

No, it's a rotating pressure type top. Just check it weekly to make sure your thunderpaws is not spinning is loose with the climbing on it! :)

Question:I live in an apartment and need to avoid huge holes. How big are the holes created by the wall mountings?
Answer:The holes don't have to be big. I would recommend you make sure you're drilling the screws into a stud, not just the drywall. The drywall won't hold it properly. It works really nice and is solid and stable when you drill into the wooden studs. Hopefully you have a stud finder or can maybe borrow one. They're not too expensive and might be worth having one in your toolbox for finding a secure attachment point in the future. My cat is a big fan of the tree and it's nice to have the rope on all sections. Gives her exercise and allows her to climb high when she wants. see less

Just one brace with a normal sized screw is needed. As long as you have normal height ceilings for the top to secure

Question:Do you have to afix this item to the ceiling?? I have very very tall ceilings (way higher than the tree) will this tree work for me?
Answer:hiÔºåif our tree can not fix to your ceiling. But never mind, we have a set fixing tool, just fix to either wall or wood is Ok.

Question:I was thinking of getting this for my basement, but the ceiling is only 6ft. Do you think this will fit?
Answer:It should fit. You can just not use one of the sections
By Tim S. on February 26, 2018
You should be able to. Just do not place one of the rope posts on so that it is shorter.

Question:My ceiling is slanted. Would I still be able to affix it to the ceiling?
Answer:if you use the mounting bracket and attach it to the wall. but no the top pad does not slant to put on a slanting cieling. but to be honest I had to put the metal l bracket on anyways because with just the ceiling mount it fell over. so yes it'll work but you'll need to use the metal l bracket and screw into the wall.
By Sean auter on January 13, 2018
No. I've found the top of the post, which is supposed to stabilize by pressure, is not very useful anyway. The post should be affixed to the wall, and comes with one bracket for doing so. (I will probably need a second bracket as I put the first one pretty far down, and now the top of the post leans away from the wall, no matter how many times I "tighten" it to my ceiling.) see less
By DC on January 16, 2018
The post doesn‚Äôt bend at the top. However, as a suggestion maybe a slanted wooden block can me used if you anchor it properly.
By regina on January 13, 2018
I would say so.. plus you have two other braces to assure it‚Äôs stability.
By Buck on January 13, 2018
Yes you can.You could use the brackets to stabilize it .

Question:The description says the height can be adjusted to 102-106". Does this mean it only fits 9' ceilings? I have an 8' ceiling, so it will not work?
Answer:Don‚Äôt buy this product. It is very unstable. It has crashed all the way over once and we have caught it from falling over several times. We have tried to tighten it to the ceiling several times but it never holds. The top ceiling support is carpeted and slides very easily when the cats jump off.

Question:How big is the round hammock part? is it like the one on the trixie pet product baza cat trees?
Answer:According to the product description for the Trixie baza, their hammock is 20" in diameter. The Roypet hammock is smaller - maybe a foot in diameter or slightly over. The metal ring is also a little bit flexible and droops with a cat in it. There is a review with photos and a video - that should help give you an idea of how your cat would fit. see less
By Once Burned on January 23, 2018
About 12 inch diameter and 6-7 inches deep. It took them a while to use them but now both of my cats curl up in them often. One up top and one down below!
By Sarah on January 27, 2018
Hi, it is 30cm DIAMETER for the hammock.
By Roypet SELLER  on January 24, 2018
Not sure of exact dimensions, but pretty good size. My 17 pound fat cat can curl up in it
By Brittany Corder on January 26, 2018
about 12 inches across and 5 deep
By Kay H on January 26, 2018
Question:Any creative people successfully shortened the height? We need it to be 7-8" shorter
Answer:just remove one of the section. the final section has a considerable adjustment hight, my ceiling was just about right without the extension, I added some of the platforms from my old tree under it to make it secure as I didn't have room for the top section.
By setzco on December 17, 2018
Question:Will this work with a popcorn ceiling?
Answer:I don't see why not. Whe have some sort of fluffy design on the ceiling. The most important part to make it stable is anchoring it to the wall.
By SWR on June 4, 2018
I would have to say yes, make sure you attach the stabilizing bars to the wall. I have 11 rescue cats and even though they raise hell on it, they can't ruin it. I absolutely love it.
By kat lady on June 7, 2018
Question:My ceiling is about 10.5 feet tall, and I was wondering if there is a way to purchase separate pieces to add onto it to make it taller?
Answer:You can purchase another post(column) from our Amazon store.
By Roypet SELLER  on June 28, 2019
I wouldn‚Äôt even buy this thing. What a waste of money I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to secure it.
