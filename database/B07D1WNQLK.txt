Question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do
Answer:I have a male Maine Coon who weighs 21 lbs. Actually, his weight only increased by a lb. or two after the first year. He's nine now, but still very active, and loves leaping up on the tree at top speed. It doesn't even wobble. The tree is so sturdy I'm sure it would work for a larger cat than mine. He's had 2 other trees, but he's always loved this one the best. He takes naps in the cradle and uses the round bed to view the world outside and talk to the birds. We've both been very pleased with it. see less

Yes it will. We have 2 Maine Coons; one is 20#, one is 16#. They are both 2 so still growing slowly. There has been no issue tipping it. They love it for bird watching.

Yes, it will. I have 6 cats, one of which is part Maine Coon and weighs 16+lbs. He lays on this all the time, and sometimes his 8lb "baby brother" lays on top of him while he is on it.

I selected this cat tree because the perches were the largest I could find on the market. I have a larger kitty and he loves it. Even the round space is big enough for him. The tower occasionally wobbles when we're playing with him with toys and he's riled up, but for chilling out it is quite stable. I found that placing a bit of weight on the bottom of the stand solved the problem. see less
