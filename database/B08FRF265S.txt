Question:What is the weight limit for the side bed/hammock?
Answer:Hi! I don't know the actual limit. But my cat is 20 lbs and he manages to squish himself into the hammock regularly, and the perch doesn't move. We have two cats, both large, and they are in the cat tree every day, on all the perches. The only one they don't use is the hammock underneath the perch.

I have a pretty big male cat who weighs about 15 pounds and he fits in there great along with my little female who weighs 7lbs and lays on top of him so that’s supporting 22lbs. Although I did swivel it to the right closer to the landing pad right there for possibly better support. It is still free hanging though. No problems! Hope this helps. see less

Question:I have 2 cats and the both weigh 18 lbs. I want to know if it’s made for large cats. Are the beds/platforms big enough and is it sturdy enough?
Answer:Yes they are quite big beds compared to other cat trees. The cushions on all 3 of the beds perimeter make more room for them as well. My cat is 15lbs+ and he sprawls out or curls up on those beds just fine!
