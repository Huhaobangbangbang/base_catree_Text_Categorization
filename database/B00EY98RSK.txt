Question:Can I leave the condo off?
Answer:It can be assembled that way, but if you leave the condo off you'll also have to leave off the top platform.

No. One of the highest perches attaches to the condo. Try another style. I like Kitty Mansions Beverly Hills. There are two cubbies and the larger one works for storing some of their toys. the top perches are cushy and have a larger edge to them. I have super big cats so this works for me. I also look for cat trees with all sisal posts. The fur fabric doesn't hold up nearly as well. Good luck! see less

No, I don't think so.

Question:Does the fabric cover both the top and bottom of the middle platform piece? I want to flip it to have the pillar on the right side, not the left.
Answer:I'm not sure of what is being asked. All pieces are only covered on the top. I just rotate the piece to put the pillars on whichever side I want. The piece is an unusual height which is great.
