Question:What is the size information of each part of the cat tree tower?
Answer:I bought this for my cats. It’s very cute but if you have a larger cat they will not fit on it. My smaller cat does but my 14 pound cat doesn’t fit at all.

Question:Can the cat hanging basket be moved to the right side of the cat tower?
Answer:I do not know, I would imagine yes, because there is a secure post on the right side, it just slipps over the post. FYI my medium size cat refuses to use it. He does not feel secure. I use it for storage, kitty toys, balls etc.
Maybe a kitty would love sleeping in it. Not my medium size cat. Hope this helps
