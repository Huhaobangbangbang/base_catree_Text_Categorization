Question:Will this work for 12!pound cat
Answer:I’m sure it will. Both my cats were 1)old and thin and 2) runt of the litter. The cat tree is a little bit on the smaller side, bigger cats might not fit on the little hammock but everything else should be fine. And 12 lbs isn’t so big compared to say 17-20+. I think it will be just fine

By Mary Jackson on October 18, 2021
