Question:Are the perches good size for an older, larger cat, or is this more for kittens?
Answer:My adult very large cat can't fit on the hammock, but he loves sitting on the perches. It's a tight fit, but he usually only sits in the perches and lays on the flat area to nap and sleep. Hope this helps. :)

Hi Jen, the perches are smaller than I hoped for but our older cats manage to lay on them anyway. The hammock is small and no one has tried that yet. The fake fur on the tree is just attached to boards and it is not as cushy as their old one. I think I would prefer carpet on the next tree we buy however this tree is attractive to look at and we get compliments on it. The cats seem to prefer the old one in the basement though. :) see less
