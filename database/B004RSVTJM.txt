Question:my cat is 12lbs do you think this would be ok ?
Answer:The platforms are not that big. The top one is approx. 10x10. My cat is about 14 lbs and will not go in the cubby hole or lay on any of the platforms. I think she's just too big. I might take it apart and make bigger platforms for her to lay on. Sorry, but I really cannot recommend this item until its been re-designed.

I think you would be much happier getting a different one. I reviewed this cat tree. My sons cat was pretty small and she has trouble navigating it. The covering is kind of slick and our cat had trouble climbing it. I think my sons cat was 5 or 6 pounds. I wouldn't buy again.

Yes. I have a 13 lb cat and it supports him without a problem. If you're concerned about it tipping over, it can be bolted to the wall. I do not have either one of my cat trees (I have 2) bolted to the wall and it's never tipped over. It's very sturdy.

My cats are 8lbs and 20lbs and both love to play on it. Only the little one fits into the cozy corner but both like the flat surfaces. I put this near a table to help both reach the higher levels as both are getting older and I don't want them to fall and hurt themselves.
By Bookie on March 25, 2014
Yes. My cat is 12 pounds & jumps on it. She doesn't jump to the top level though.
By Lynn Felsheim on March 25, 2014
I think you would be pushing it if your cat is very active. My kitten is only 7 lbs and it can wobble some if shes on the edge of it. The house would be a tight fit also but some cats like small places. Mine loves to stretch out so she hasnt been in it much. Hope this helps. I guess you could nail it to the floor and would have no problems per husband. lol. see less

Question:Will my 8.5lb and 16lb cat be able to fit inside the hole? Is this a good tree for cats that size? They are just normal house cats.
Answer:YES! My cats are BIG cats - long and big - and my little girl who is 14.4 pounds can get in and out easily. My little boy doesn't care for the hole or the cubby - but at 13.6 pounds he could fit (maybe even in there along with my little girl - although it would be tight)...
By Brenda Marie on August 29, 2018
Maybe the 8lb cat but not the 16lb one. My cat is 5 and this is his first house that we know of. In order for him to use the hole we had to put treats in it otherwise he could care less about it. He usually jumps to the 2nd and 3rd level. Thr third he barely fits on and he's about 10lbs give or take.
By Debbie on April 17, 2014
My cat is only 8 months old so she does not weigh as much as your cats..however its pretty nice size inside i think they should be fine just be sure to have it in a corner due to the sizes of your cats jumping up it my cause it to Rick but..my cat booms all over it crazy not once had it fell over..i recommend this evenâ€¦ see more
By Shacara on April 17, 2014
I believe your cats will fit inside. My cat is very long and is able to curl up to nap with plenty of room left for another cat if we had one. The hole is plenty big enough for a cat larger than mine to fit through.
By Terrie Mayhew on April 17, 2014
Our cat is 8 lbs and she fits just fine- although she hardly ever goes in there. I don't think sure the 16 lb would fit. The whole is about 7" across. Our cat will go on the first and second levels but the third level is a little wobbly for her.
By Erin E. on April 17, 2014
I would think both cats could fit in the hole, separately that is. It is 7" in diameter.

Question:Do your cats (for the most part) like to scratch on the posts of this tree? We hope the cats will prefer this to scratching on our furniture!
Answer:We only have one cat. And she does scratch the tree quite often. She is still a kitten, so from time to time we catch her scratching other things. But once we put cat nip on the scratching posts, there was even less scratching. She climbs and scratches the posts mainly.
By MSV on September 4, 2013
Right now it's about 50/50. We grab Koosi immediately when she starts to scratch the furniture and put her on the second tier of the tree. She usually keeps scratching on the tree and leaves the furniture alone for the rest of the day. (It's a learning process.) I've also been told to sprinkle the tree with catnip to encourage her to use it. But I haven't gotten to the pet store to get any yet, so I don't know personally if that helps. see less
By B. Dunlap on September 5, 2013
Not a lot luck with that, our cat does not normally scratch the posts on this tree. However our cat does not scratch very much as all, because every time she makes an attempt we have a spray bottle with water in it to deter her from doing such things. Just a spray and the cat will be out of there like there's no tomorrow. Now all we have to do it point the spray bottle at her and she runs. see less
By James Lathrop on September 4, 2013
My cats do scratch on the posts of the tree but I also keep other things around for them to scratch on just to give them a variety so they will not feel the need to mark their territory on our chairs, walls, or couches. I would also recommend putting cat nip on the things that you want them to be attracted to. Hope this helped. :) see less
By P. Romeo on September 4, 2013
At least one of the cats regularly uses the post. Though we use the simple cardboard scratching blocks, and they both love those. We put them in front of the furniture we don't want them to scratch, then slowly reposition the blocks to areas aesthetically acceptable to my wife:) But to directly answer your question, yes, they seem to prefer the rough rope of the tree to furniture. Hope that helps! see less
By Jeff on September 4, 2013
my cat does not replace her favourite leather chair (my fav chair in fact) with this tree. Hope this helps.

Question:I rescued a kitty who is declawed, will he be able to use this product just by jumping?
Answer:Your kitty should totally enjoy being able to jump between the levels with no problem. At least you won't have to deal with the sisal rope coming off since he won't be clawing it. If he needs an incentive to get to the higher levels, try putting some catnip in the carpet.
By cherith_girl on April 1, 2014
Absolutely. The older cat - multi-toed is a front declaw and he plays on the top all the time. Jumps to the upper platform with no troubles.... He plays with it as much as the 6 month old kitten.
By L. A Snyder on April 1, 2014
Yes! Unless he's injured he should be able to easily jump to the second platform. My cats prefer to climb them like stairs.
By ElanaExtraordinaire on April 1, 2014
Yes, the distances between levels is not so great that your cat should be able to use all levels.
By Kindle Customer on April 1, 2014
most definitely my two cats jump on and off it without using their claws all day
By Trippy-Tees on April 2, 2014
I believe so. The platforms aren't that terribly high so jumping on them should be of no issue.
By Megan Russell on April 1, 2014
yes, the lowest level is less then 10 inches off the ground
By Amy Griswold on April 5, 2014
Question:Is it possible to assemble it so the highest platform is on the left, instead of on the right as pictured?
Answer:Yes it is, there is a particular piece in the assembly that the directions tell you to use on the right hand post but you could easily switch it to be used on the left.
By Tara Selly on September 16, 2014
No I don't think so. There are holes in it already for where to screw in each piece.
By Sarah M. on September 16, 2014
Yes, it can go on either side.
By Janice Beckner on September 16, 2014
Question:Is this treated with cat nip?
Answer:No it is not. So far my cat will not go near it, but she is only 3 mo. old.
By Karen Martin on February 20, 2014
I doubt it. I put catnip on it and my cats still won't go near it. Oh, well.
By B. Perkins on February 20, 2014
Not sure but my cat loves this!
By JOE MOLALE on February 20, 2014
I can't remember for certain but I think it came with a small bag of catnip.
By Amy Griswold on February 20, 2014
No -but I added some to get their attention!
They love it!
By Jefferson Mitchell on February 24, 2014
I don't believe so. It's hard, coated in feathers, and rattles.
By Just Curious on February 20, 2014
No I don't believe it is, but otherwise a fantastic product!
By Andrea on February 20, 2014

Answer:13-inches by 13-inches
By M. Kough on July 21, 2014
About 13 and half inches...

Question:What is the diameter of the hole in the house?
Answer:The hole measures 7" in diameter.
By Andrea on April 21, 2014
It is 7 inches...hope this helps
By Amanda Froehlich on April 20, 2014
Question:The dimensions say the base size is 16" x 16" but it also says the overall dimensions are 19" x 19". Any way to assemble it to keep overall size at 16
Answer:My answer is no. I am not the engineer but the problem is the top tier, with it has an overhang that it extend past the base.
By Cindy L Perkins on November 25, 2016
The top tier is what puts it over. You don't have to add it though.
By Madeleine on November 27, 2016
Question:The second image indicates this product is 68" tall, but the product description says 51". Which is correct?
Answer:Sorry correction...the cat tower is actually 51"...I just remeasured the heigth!
By Amazon Customer on January 8, 2017
It's 52", which is still pretty tall
By Jeremy S on January 8, 2017
Neither...once put together it is actually 45" in height. My cat loves her new condo!

Question:You can send this product to Brazil, POSTAL CODE 12305-810?
Answer:We cannot not.

Question:Is it made with carpet or fur like covering?
Answer:Fur like covering, not carpeting. I have one rescue cat & she loves the tree!
By Trishaâ€¦ on December 27, 2014
Fur like covering. Very soft and our cat loves to scratch on it
By Momof3 on December 27, 2014
It's kind of a hybrid. It's short like a carpet, but soft like "fur". I vacuum with a hand vac to clean. My car loves this product.
By RMW on December 27, 2014
This is like fur covering.
By Lmo on January 3, 2015
It is a fur like covering.
By Julie Baumler on December 27, 2014
It's not "fur" really, more of a soft micro-fiber, but it's very pet-able. My cat loves to snuggle up on it, and scrat the sisal twine on the posts.
