Question:Can‚Äôt figure out step eight
Answer:Step 8 is to anchor it to the wall. The attached strap can be attached to the wall to give it more stability. I did not use it as I have it sitting by a window and find it stable enough without it.

Question:I can‚Äôt get past step 4 and can‚Äôt find a video on YouTube for this specific model. Help!
Answer:Dear customer,
Thank you for your kind answer.
Thank you for your great support on our shop.
The step 4 is to put the board B on the two C1 posts, in this step, you need to use the two S1 screws to assemble the B board and also use the small S4 hook to help tightening the screws.

Question:Im getting a kitten soon, i was wondering would this be fine for it when its a kitten and a full grown cat?
Answer:I think that it would work just fine at all your little one's stages of life. Kittens are very nimble and will figure out climbing quickly. My adults cats like it a lot. One of mine spends most of the day on the top level, looking out of the window.
By Melanie Trowbridge on February 26, 2022
Yep, we got it when we first got our kitten and he's now close to 12 lbs at a year and still sleeps in the bucket area and uses the cat tree daily.
By Christie on February 26, 2022
Yes, this is perfect for kittens and grown cats
By Sahar on February 28, 2022
Yes my cats are now a year old and chunky and they both still love this tree
By Danielle Fiske on February 26, 2022
Question:The very top of the tree doesn‚Äôt screw on. Is it supposed to hook to a wall?
Answer:Dear Customer,
Thanks a lot for your question.
The eighth step is to assemble the belt to the wall to prevent the cat tree from falling down.
If you have any other question,please feel free to contact us.

Everything screws together. Nothing HAS to be attached to a wall.

Question:What‚Äôs the weight limit for cats
Answer:Im not sure of the cat weight limit, but my toddler loves climbing on it and she‚Äôs 20lbs and the only spot that doesn‚Äôt hold her is the hanging canopy bed. She safely sits on the ledge and the very top. Hopefully that helps give you some idea.

My cats are 10-12 lbs each and it is about right. If they were bigger , it might ne a little small. They both use it every day. Plush is very soft and they love the scratching posts.

We have a 18lb cat and he lays in it with no problems.

Question:What is the weight limit for the kitten basket?
Answer:Our small female cat who weighs about 3.5 lbs sleeps in it normally. Her sibling, a neutered male, who is a little on the heavy side at 8 lbs, has been known to try to fit in it and it seems to hold his weight just fine.

Our cat is about 14 pounds. The hammock looks like it is for a kitten or smaller cat. I don‚Äôt believe it would safely hold our large cat. She has reached into it for a treat. . The other platforms can hold our cat fine. It is very sturdy! üëè

Question:How do I attach the bed to the posts? The bed goes into the screws just fine but I don‚Äôt see any area to tighten it.
Answer:I am trying to remember how it went together. I am thinking that I attached the posts to the bed by turning the posts to tighten them . Then I attached the posts to the bottom section which I had put together first. I do know that I followed the instructions that came with the tower and it went together seamlessly.

Answer:I think you could skip it
