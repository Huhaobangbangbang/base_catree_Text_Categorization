Question:Is this sturdy enough for an almost 20 lb ginormous orange tabby cat?
Answer:Yes! I have a 20lb ginormous cat who loves it! He feels safe and secure on all levels of it. I didn‚Äôt attach it to the wall with the provided tools, but I do have it against the wall. He and my kitten jump all over it and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it.
By Cx182 on July 10, 2020
I would say yes. My cats are 17lb and 15 lb. respectively. Althought I do want to suggest you secure it with the strap to the wall. My cats use this condo all the time and I‚Äôm beyond pleased with it and they love it..

What does "orange tabby" have to do with anything? A 20lb cat is a 20lb cat.

I think so, one of my cats is 13 pounds. It‚Äôs sturdy enough but the little beds are almost too small, he doesn‚Äôt mind though!
By Brooke Lamb on July 10, 2020
Probably everything but the very top level. I'm not sure how much our kitty weighs now, but he still uses it. It seems a bit wiggly at that point, but I would guess it's solid enough on every other level. It really is a great piece of cat furniture, and our cat uses it every day! Hope that helps!
By Laurel Draper on July 11, 2020
Yes it's very sturdy, my cat loves it
By Tasha Foster on July 12, 2020
Yes we have 4 cats and one is pretty hefty. They all 4 have been in it at the same time and no problem.

Question:Is this good for big cats?
Answer:My cats are about 12, 11, and 9 pounds. The smallest one fits and likes the little hideaways and uses it quite a bit. The other two only sometimes, because they don't fit as well, and never stay as long. So, I would say that if your cat(s) are truly big, this may not work well.

Answer:It's 58.3 inches. I'm 5'4" and it was up to my shoulders forsure. But the purching posts are small.. My 10 lb cats couldnt fit on em, they kept falling off. This is more for kittens/teenage cats.

Question:What are the posts made out of?
Answer:I believe the posts were made of a heavy cardboard tube but had a wooden insert on each end with "T"- Nuts for mounting so far they have proven to be very sturdy and stout. No Complaints
By Mike Welch on October 20, 2021
I‚Äôm guessing heavy cardboard. Posts are wrapped with same carpeting as main parts plus macrame-like cordage for scratch post area.

Question:I purchased a cat tree that had carpet directly on the wood. No cushioning at all! I see in a couple places it‚Äôs plush. What about the rest?
