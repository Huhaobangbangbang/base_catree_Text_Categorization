As many as possible. Our first installation, the studs did not line up where we wanted to place the unit. We used wall anchors and within a few days, it was pulling out of the wall. We bought pine boards, stained them to match the shelves and installed those into the studs. We then hung the unit on those boards. Even our 15 lb cat doesn't move them any more. see less
