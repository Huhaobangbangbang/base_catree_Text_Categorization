Question:Will this work for a 16 lb Maine Coon?
Answer:I think it might be a little small for a 16 lb Maine Coon. My cats are about 10-12 lbs each and if one of them is on the top or one of the other spots they fill it up.

Question:How stable is the light gray/gray tower?
Answer:My cats are both around 12 lbs. They like to lay at the top of the tower (not at the same time). I have never noticed it being unsteady when the jump up into it, while they are in it, or when they jump down. I have been very happy with it.

Question:What is this product made of? Carpet?
Answer:Sisal with soft carpet in lounging areas.

It's a sisal on the outside and carpet on the top and inside perches.
By Jill H. on April 28, 2014
The outside is covered in a sisal rug material. It wears great, does not pull like carpet, and my cats use it everyday. The top insides and openings are covered in a faux fur. It is soft, so they sleep on the top and inside. It is easy to vacuum.
By Judy M on April 28, 2014
Some kind of Fleece-like material on the inside, and that sisal stuff everywhere else. My cats like it.
By Tia T on April 28, 2014
It's made of sisal. Very tight weave and scratchy.

Question:How tall is the tower when the "top platform with removable bed" is removed? What is the material on top of the tower without the bed?
Answer:25 inches high without separate platform and separate bed. Top without platform is just uncovered plain MDF with a inch trim of fabric around the edge, from the fabric wrapping up from the tower covering.

It's almost 26-inches and is made of something like particle board. My youngest kitty likes to scratch on it and will sleep inside on the lowest level. With a strong cat, you might need to keep it stable between 2 items because he has had it fall over on him once.

Question:Is this 2 sided? One picture shows inside, but maybe that’s just for you to see inside?
Answer:2 sided as in it is wrapped all around. I have 2 of these and my cats absolutely love them.

I'm sorry but I did not buy this cat condo. It looks nice though.

Question:The picture shows a middle passthrough between the lower and middle compartments. Is there a passthrough between the top an middle compartments?
Answer:Yes. The opening goes all the way from the lower compartment to the top compartment. The very top of it is a solid rest, so the very top has no access to the lower three compartments.
By no one in particular on January 18, 2015
No. The top isn't connected to the lower compartments
By kathleen l hitt on January 18, 2015
Yes, it goes all the way through. Just to let you know, if you have cats larger than 12lbs or so, they won't fit in this condo very well if at all. This is built for kittens more than adult cats.

Question:We purchased this and it arrived today - but the screw provided doesn't actually screw into the top so it won't stay on? :(
Answer:Hi.

Not sure that I have enough details from you but I will try.
The screw that holds the top platform on, screws in from underneath the top platform (that the bed stretches over). So, you must reach into the top level cubby hole to the ceiling to do so. Once the screw is seated, you just turn the platform clock wise to tighten it up, but do not over tighten it.
Is this what you have been trying to do? Also do you have the right tool to fit the head of the screw? If I remember correctly, I think it was provided with the product. It is a nice tower. Good luck.

I did not purchase this one so I am unable to help you. The one that I bought was a little different and I didn't have to do anything as far as assembling. Sorry!
By S. Fogeltanz on November 23, 2017
Question:Does this come in one piece or is assembly required?
Answer:It comes in one piece.
By ddtp on January 9, 2019
One piece

Question:Can you swivel / move each tier of this tower? Thanks!
Answer:No, you cannot.

Question:to Trixie: I want to buy just the removable top pad for the 15.75 x 15.75 x 29 inches model. How can I do that?
Answer:I believe that you can obtain a replacement top bed for the model shown in cases for example where your original one has been damaged. You must contact Trixie directly on their website to make the request.

Good luck.

Not sure if you can. Hopefully you will be able to. I sure love mine. Should rephrase that, Pepper loves it.. I guess you could contact Trixie.
Question:How does one assemble this? What hardware is required?
Answer:Not a bit of mechanical assembly required, just put the the top covering with its attached bed on and the interior cushions in place. My 7 & 12-yr old cats aren't interested in it though, not even the sisal scratching area on the side which surprised me...
By Carol B. on January 8, 2016
Question:On the gray one, does the sisal go all the way around, except for where the holes for the beds are? Or is the sisal just a small strip on one side?
Answer:I have the same, except brown, and the sisal covers the entire back half of the tower. I have mine against the window sill so much of the sisal is blocked, but one of my cats loves to lay on the top to sleep or look out the window. My tower only has one opening in the front so I don't know whether that makes a difference or not for our sisal question. see less
By Rural Rocker on July 28, 2019
The sisal covered the whole exterior of the tower with the exception of the holes
By RABBIT on July 28, 2019
Sisal on one side only
By V. Smith on May 29, 2020
One side but fairly wide
By Gail Gram on July 28, 2019
