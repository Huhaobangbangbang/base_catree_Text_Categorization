Question:What is the interior of the pole made out of? What is the weight limit for cats on it?
Answer:The poles were a big disappointment to me. Judging by the name that says sisal poles, one would think that it has just that. The 2 lower poles are covered in carpet and the top pole has their paper rope. The only thing close to sisal is the rope hanging down that has no appeal to my playful cats.

It says it supports 10lb cat but if you read further you‚Äôll see 10lb kitten or small cat. My 9lb 2yr doesn‚Äôt fit on the carpet round part and my compact older cat around 8lbs has no interest in it.

This is impossible to return and my cats have zero use for cat scratch ‚Äúsisal poles‚Äù not sisal and something that doesn‚Äôt fit them. see less

I'm not sure what the pole is made of. Our cat is 12 lbs. This easily supports her weight, but it makes me a little nervous when she jumps from the ground to the top perch. It supports her weight just fine, but it threatens to tip over from the inertia of the jumping. You may need to stabilize it or put it against a wall so it doesn't fall over if your cat is a little bit larger. She does love being in this and just fits to curl up on the top perch. see less

I haven't taken the thing apart since I assembled, but I think it was wood. I thought it was too small for my cat since he is thin, but very lanky and long. But he curls up on the curved lower area just fine. I put it in the window, so that may be why he doesn't use the upper area. He scratches the pole and seems to like it. I will put in a PSA that if you are worried your cat is too heavy for this, then your cat is fat and you need to put them on a diet. see less

Question:Could anyone tell me how to stick part d into part b? There isn‚Äôt a hole on part b so I can‚Äôt combine these two part together
Answer:If it is the carpet area you really need to search for the hole, it took me a minute. If the hole isn‚Äôt there then you got a defective one and will need to return it and buy another one or contact the manufacturer. Good luck!

Question:Could the cradle go ip top...basically switch top bed and bottom cradle around??? TY!
Answer:I think you could switch the cradle and top bed. My only concern would be that it might be pretty top heavy. I would recommend anchoring it to the floor.
By Christy Cooper on May 11, 2020
My daughter said the tops could not be switched around because the cradle actually attaches to both poles...hope this helps...Dj
