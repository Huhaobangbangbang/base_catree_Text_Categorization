Question:Are the posts made of sisal rope?
Answer:Yes, the posts are covered in sisal rope. They use double sided tape to keep it on the posts. My cats aren't declawed and it had a few years of use before the sisal started to get shredded off. Once it started to go though, it went fast on the lowest posts. The Armarkat website sells replacement posts but at $18-21 per post, it would be better to do it yourself re-roping or just buy a new tower. If you buy your own sisal, make sure its UNOILED. Oiled sisal can hurt or kill cats I've read. see less

This doesn't look like the model I purchased. But my model's posts are made of sisal rope and they are well done.
By Shellie on October 7, 2013
Posta are covered with sisal rope. Also, just as info...the unit is so very simple to assemble. I have no tools and very little mechanical skills and I put it together by my self in less than an hour. Very sturdy product and my cats love it.
By F. mize on October 7, 2013
Yes, all the posts are wrapped with heavy twine. I assume it is sisal but really I don't know. It's thick, heavy twine about as thick as a pencil. My cats give it a good work out and they are holding up well.
By Geordie on October 7, 2013
The posts are covered with sisal rope....my cat uses them a great deal!
By Christine J. Peppler on October 7, 2013
yes and very durable. our bigger cat would get into a frenzy and stop for a scratch at the posts. the posts took a beating from her but stayed in great shape.

Question:How high is the lowest platform from the ground? I have an older cat that can't jump very high. My younger cats would love the higher ones!
Answer:The lowest platform is 11" off the ground. It has a nice size for a cat to perch. You'll love this tree - and so will your cats!
Note - in reading the other comments, I'm thinking that some of us are talking about different trees. Mine is the pale blue (very pretty) one, and every support pole is also a scratching post. The size is 38"(L)X24"(W)X66"(H). see less
By Alicia on May 6, 2014
It's 14 1/2 inches to the top of the bottom platform. I have 2 cats that are 14 and they act like kittens on it. They all love it and so glad I bought it for them. They really enjoy scratching it, climbing to the top and nap on it too. Can watch the birds out the window.
By L Ruiz on May 5, 2014
From the floor the first landing is 11 inches, the next....14" from that 11" one .....next 9 1/2 and the top is 20 1/2 . It is a great cat tree and my sweet little black cat loves it. It took a few days for her to 'think about it'... but now loves it. I hide treats on it and when she wants a treat she head for the tree... It was well worth the money and very attractive as well. see less

Hi, The cat tree stands on a main platform and from that is 10 inches but 11 inches from the floor.
By Kimberly A Strickland on May 5, 2014
14 inches off the ground, next level is 6 inches higher.
By Age Dee on May 5, 2014
The lowest platform is 15 inches to the top of the platform.

Question:I have a very large cat whose 15lbs+ does anyone know how large the platforms are?
Answer:I have a Maine Coon that weighs 20 pounds. I have had this A6501 for 7 years now and the only thing she has worn out is the scratch posts. She loves to curl up on the top square platform, large enough for my tiger!
By JCRG on July 12, 2017
Not very large. The top platform is only 10x12 and wobbly, and the other smaller ones are the same. The larger one below the top tier is large enough, but you will have to remove the rope scratcher. My 18 pounder won't go anywhere near this tree, but my 8 pounders love it. I would look for something larger for a cat th… see more
By Brenda Holland on October 25, 2014
One of my cats is near 20 pounds, the other about 8.
They were both on the top shelves this morning. Then love this thing.
It's their forth. They are hard on the scratching posts.
By H. Jack Morgan on February 22, 2022
2 platforms are 13 x 14 and the top condo is 12" round
By hobofishing on October 25, 2014
I don't know the exact size, but my cat is 20 pounds and he lies on all platforms. He loves it.
By Rebecca Batson on October 25, 2014
I wish I would have read more before purchasing. I have a ten pound active cat and it's so wobbly he can't hardly stand it. It I could slide it against a wall for stability it would be great but even if I put it in a corner(away from Windows:( ) it's still a bit wobbly. Guess the old tree will stick around a bit longer!

Question:Can the condo box and/or tube be left off (not installed) without leaving any uncovered (bare) spots on the platforms?
Answer:Yes! The mounting holes are not rough and do not have any burs on them. Leaving off a rope or a piece of the cat condo is no problamo. I like to change it up every once in a while to keep the cats on their toes.
By Amazon Customer on April 20, 2016
You leave off any parts that you don't want and there won't be any bare spots.
By Delilah on April 18, 2016
All of the pre-drilled holes are covered with carpet that you can easily punch the screws through. If you can see anything, you might see the screw top. It shouldn't be overly noticible. Hope this helps!
By Meagan on April 18, 2016
Question:What kind of tool do you use to tighten the screws that hold the posts on. It looks like a allen wrench but it convex.
Answer:Sally the tool for assembling the tree comes inside the package along with the hardware. It is an allen wrench and it works great.
By Joanna H. B. on March 14, 2014
My package came with two tools, one Allen for the bolts and one for the nuts.
By Savage on March 13, 2014
It comes with the cat tree -- you don't need anything besides what's included. I would just make sure to tighten everything again a couple of days after set-up and use, and check every couple of weeks to see if anything is loose and re-tighten if necessary. It really is very, very easy!
By Age Dee on March 14, 2014
It came with the tool. It was very easy to assemble.

Question:What is the size of the package it is shipped in?
Answer:Actually pretty big.....maybe the size of a large microwave
By Mbdn on March 8, 2013
It's big - I don't know exact dimensions but the base, which is the largest piece, measures 31" x 25" and it fits in the box well, with little space around it. The weight on the box was 55 lbs.

Question:i i put this tree on a carpet, will it be stable enough? I see all the pictures where cat tree stands on a hard floor or tile floor.
Answer:Well mine is on a hard floor, but it just jiggles a bit with my 2 very active young cats. Think diving off the very top, on to a counter 8 feet away!!! It's a lot heavier than it looks too.
By L.L. on October 10, 2015
I had mine on a carpet and it was fine. My cat runs and jumps on it and jumps off from the top. It has never toppled, not even close.
By Elle on October 13, 2015
Mine is on carpet and its fine, the only time out wobbles is when the cat literally ROCKETS himself onto it to escape the hyper dogs in our home :) even then though, it has never fallen over. I love this thing, it works great and my cat uses it all the time.
By Megan Barros on October 10, 2015
Yes, depending on the pile of your carpet. We have 2 cats and its fine.
By Robert Moorhouse on October 10, 2015
Question:Does anyone know the dimensions between each tier?
Answer:The bottom tier is 23" to next tier. Then 13" to next, then 13" to one top side and 22" to other top side. P.S. This pic looks different than mine.
By R. S. Levik on February 19, 2018
Hi,
For the bottom plate and the fourth plate under the house, they are both of dimension 22"*22". And the second layer and third layer are of size 22“*16" and 22"*14".
By armarkat SELLER  on February 20, 2018
I believe it's on the directions, which I threw away. But I have 2 cats both over 18 pounds and a kitten that's only 2.5 pounds and the tree is perfect for all 3
By Holly Hand on February 21, 2018
sorry, I don't. I have 4 cats, from fairly large to fairly small. They all fit. They all love it.
By Jayne Church on February 19, 2018
I'm sorry. I don't have that particular model.
By Colin Lee Blake on February 19, 2018
No clue, sorry.
By Christina on February 20, 2018
Question:My cat likes to scratch carpet and carpet-like material... a lot. Would this fabric hold up?
Answer:I believe I can answer that "yes" with confidence. My cat LOVES this thing. I mean it is a bit of an imposing presence, but, we are love-us-love-our-cat kind of people. As to the scratching, all the posts connecting the platforms are wrapped in sisal rope, which cats lots to scratch, and ours scratches all the different levels, a lot.Since we keep her indoors, we feel like it's a great way for her to exercise the kind of muscles she would climbing a tree. see less
By S. L. Miller on February 6, 2018
My cat scratches the crap out of the posts, but not so much the carpet itself. I will say that I have ZERO complaints with the quality of construction. My cat LOVES to sit at the top, and never scratches any of my other furniture. For those reasons alone it was worth the cost to me!
By Jessica A. Schwartz on February 5, 2018
Yes, it’s very durable. My cat tears everything up and he loves scratching and pulling at this carpet. It’s holding up very well.
By Heather C on February 5, 2018
This is covered in a "fleece-like" material rather than the more typical medium-shag carpet that most cat trees are covered in. Having had one of these for only a few months, I do not see any significant wear -- and the cats (I have two) seem not to shred the fleece as much as they do the more traditional cat trees that I also have. Frankly, I was concerned that this was less durable than the carpet, but it would seem that it is more durable -- I'm not finding the loose bits of yarn that I commonly find collecting round the base of the other cat-trees I have. While all cat trees will suffer from the depredations caused by cat-use, this one seems to be quite durable. The "rope" covered posts are particularly durable and are a real plus compared to the carpet covered posts I have on the other trees. Short answer: In my experience, this is a very durable cat-tree. see less
By Pete from across the River on February 6, 2018
All of the posts are good, sturdy scratching posts. The "carpet" is more like a soft fur, not durable, heavy, duty carpet
By Jenny on February 5, 2018
Yes, I think it would based on our experience with a similar cat tree. Great company!!
By Miranda on February 6, 2018
Question:is the little rope thing on the second highest level removable?
Answer:It is not removable
By StateLineTack SELLER  on January 18, 2016
The puff ball on ours is connected by an elastic string which connects to a rope loop on the platform. That loop could be cut off, or you can just untie the elastic string and puff ball.
By L. Hunter on January 21, 2016
Yes. At first I wasn't going to put it on as my cats have never used items like that to scratch, but I decided to give it a try. Both cats snuggle against it and rub on it.
By GKSTCoach on January 18, 2016
Yeah, it screws in so you have the option to include it or not.
By Luke on January 17, 2016
Question:Is there catnip on it?
Answer:Sorry, there isn't catnip on it.
By armarkat SELLER  on May 29, 2018
No there isn't any on it.
By Bobbi K. on May 28, 2018
Not that I can tell.
By Mitzi on May 29, 2018
Question:What are the heights of the various platforms from the floor? We need a taller cat tree than the one we have so the dog will leave the cat food alone
Answer:The top 2 are 54 and 68 inches, the top of the box is about 48 inches and it had a lip around the top that could hold the food bowl in place. I have 4 cats, I being 22 pound Maine Coon. He loves the box, but can only fit half his body in it, but he doesn't care. They don't get on the top 2 highest platforms. Mine are 12 years and 14 years. see less
By Brenda on February 5, 2015
Hi, here are the heights from bottom to top - 14", 20", 34" (this is the bottom of the house), 48" (this is the top of the house), 54" and 67". Hope that helps :)
By Carol on February 5, 2015
I no longer have the topshelf/resting area. My cat broke it off, but here are the rough estimates. I hope it helps. Starting from the bottom and working up: 14" floot to fixt
5" next shelf
13" next shelf
Box is 13" tall
19" from (next to) box to the first tower
By Son on February 14, 2015
Unless your dog is a climber, the higher levels (top three, not bottom two) will be out of reach. Even if your dog IS a climber, I think the top two levels will be safe--it's unlikely he'll get past the little enclosed "house." (If it's a big dog, you might think of putting the food inside that little house.)
By Kate Maloy on February 5, 2015
I'm 5 feet and the top platform is over my head and the next one down is about 4'9"
By Anonymous on February 5, 2015
The levels are at 14, 20, 34, 48, 55, and 66 inches above the base.
