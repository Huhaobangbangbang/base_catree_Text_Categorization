Hi it's some kind of wood this is my 3rd one in 8 years and they last I still have one of the original ones I bought gave the other away! Very sturdy but the rope can unravel after years..highly recommend!

P.S. The old one was made by Armarkat, too. They have the best ones as far as I know.

Plywood, I think. It's very sturdy. My kitty loves it! He had another one for 12 years before this and the only reason I got him a new one was because it had ivory carpet which eventually became too difficult to keep looking clean. I like this one much better and the kitty does, too!
