Question:What's the weight limit?
Answer:Not sure of the weight limit. I have 2 cats one is 18 pounds, this is not suitable for him, he has never tried to play with it or lay on it, he would not fit. The other cat is about 10-12 pounds, she loves it, plays on it, sleeps on it, jumps off it. I have found it to be very sturdy, still in good shape.

I have a 17 lb cat, that hangs out on this all the time. I got it when he was a kitten, so he's used to it, but he still loves it even though it's a little small for his current size (he hangs over/out the ends). My other females (6 & 12 lbs) both love it as well. I've had mine for over a year, and it's still in great shape. see less

I have a 12 lb cat that fits in the tube pretty well (though he has to finagle getting in the middle). The first wing ripped off in 2 weeks, but the second held until about 3 months. I think he might actually like it better without them, though, because the posts are easier to get. I would NOT recommend this tree for a cat over 13/14 lbs because I don't think they'd be able to get into/out of the tube. see less

The ad said it was up to 20lb (if I remember correctly) but my 13lb girl does not feel safe enough to jump on it. She just plays with the dangle and the scratch poles.

Question:How sturdy is the fabric if your cats scratch at it?
Answer:The fabric is not sturdy at all. It is very thin. The Condo is very small too. My Kittens are were 7 months old and didn't fit on it.
By Luv4Paws on December 8, 2013
It's not carpet so it's not as sturdy but I only use this condo for my kittens under 3 mo so their little claws don't really pull up the fabric. They actually prefer to scratch the rope and not the fabric. If my older cats used this post and scratched the fabric then I doubt it would hold up long. It works great as a kitten post. We've had ours over 6 mo with constant kitten use (we're fosters) and despite the screws coming loose a few times, and the dangly toys only lasting a day...we're happy with it considering the price :) see less

My cat always scratched hers and we never had a problem with it :-)
By Bobbie Lynn on December 7, 2013
The fabric is OK,but my cats are adult cats and could not fit on this.way too small
By K. Bonnevier on December 8, 2013
Question:My Cat is about 11lb and wondering is this would be too small for her. Many reviews have different comments. Any opinions? thanks
Answer:If your cat likes boxes that are "too small" for her, she'll like this too. That's our experience anyhow.
By Diane Farr on May 25, 2015
It's a short cat tree in my opinion; he can't lay in the part where it's made for them to lay in he's to long he hangs out of it...he only uses the scratch portion of it- I would post a picture to give you an idea but there isn't an option for me to do...I'm sorry I wish I could be of better help...I can say this my cat is about 11 pounds and it's too small...in my opinion this is good for kittens see less
By SAILA DIAZ on May 25, 2015
Yes, its a good fit. My female cat is 7 lb and my male cat is 21 lb. They both love it. It takes them a few days to get used to, because of the pattern making them think its a animal.
By Joe Migliaccio on May 25, 2015
I would say it would be too small. I bought this for a 9 month kitten - she's maybe 5 pounds and it's perfect for her but I have a larger older cat and she looks huge next to it - she hasn't even touched it. For a larger cat - I would stick with the taller trees ( my bigger one uses that one every day)
By Maura Fitzgeraldâ€¦ on May 25, 2015
My cat is 15lbs, and she sleeps on the sofa lounge part just fine
By Andrea W Angelzzz on May 25, 2015
Question:is it good for big cats?
Answer:Depends how big "big" is. The wings are stapled on and won't last long (regardless of cat-size), but my cat seemed to like it just as much without the wings. The tube will comfortably accommodate a 12 - 13 lb cat... not sure about a larger one than that.
By Kate on November 30, 2013
YES! Whoever said "I'm sorry it's not good for big cats" needs to tell that to my 16+lb chonky orange tabby because it's his FAVORITE place in the house. He sleeps in the tube every night.
By Samantha Zaruba on January 8, 2019
Our kittens like it best! But our big fat cat is lazy (picture Garfield here) , so he isn't a good measure to go by- but he isn't interested in it!
By Melodie's Corner on November 29, 2013
I am sorry it is not good for big cats.
By Dinah on December 2, 2013
I'd say no.
By Siobhan Kenna on November 29, 2013
Yes
By Gino on November 29, 2013

Question:is this supposed to be sturdy? I put it together and it wobbles a bit. I have to put it up against the wall so it's solid when my 3 month kitten jumps
Answer:It seems sturdy enough to me. I tightened all the bolts as much as I could. There's some wobble that seems to be due to the design. My 5 month old kitten is awfully rambunctious and it's holding up to her hyperactivity just fine.
By Matt S. on November 19, 2015
Mine went together very solid and not wobbly at all. My cat is 18 pounds and it holds up to her. You may need to tighten yours up if it's doing that with a kitten
By Mimi Gallant on November 19, 2015
Mine is definitely very sturdy. The smaller perch in the front moves a tiny amount, but nothing that even effects my largest 12lb cat from jumping on it.
By LunaCatMeow on November 19, 2015
Mine wobbles a bit too, and like you I set it up against the wall.
By Rere on November 19, 2015
You might have got a bad set up. I would maybe think about sending it back. I put it together and have had no problems with the way it moves. It sometimes will wobble but that is just how the toy is.
By jerry taylor atkins on November 19, 2015
I put mine together and you can tighten it some (with the tightener sent with to put it together. My does wobble a little - but I believe that is normal.

Question:Can I order replacement parts?
Answer:If you call the manufacturer, they will sell you replacement parts, I am sure. I needed one of the columns replaced and they said they would sell me one but then I remedied the problem I had on my own. :o)
By Linda3IHN on April 19, 2016
Question:My cat only has 3 legs. She doesn't have any trouble getting around, but I'm wondering if she can get into the cubby hole. Anyone have any idea?
Answer:It's not that far off the ground and my cats love it although they like sleeping on the bench part. I sprinkled it with catnip and they took to it almost immediately. I volunteer at a cat shelter and we have had 3 legged cats before and they seemed to climb into things with no problems. Hope this helps.
By shauna lindsey on February 24, 2016
My cat's have no problem getting in the cubby hole. They kinda dive in it lol. I think this would be perfect for your cat. It's not to high off the ground and if she can jump and get around she will love this. I absolutely love mine and couldn't have bought a better one this size for the price. Hope that helps with your question :) see less
By Amber Tabor on February 24, 2016
Question:Does anyone know if you can order new posts for this??
Answer:Well considering they wanted to charge me $23 for a little replacement part that was damaged when I bought it, it's would be better just to get a new one.
By Melissa S. on March 7, 2016
You don't want to don't buy it it comes it's not even to my knees such a joke such a waste of money
By Lacey on March 6, 2016
No, you basically have to rebuild it yourself. It feel apart within a week with my 6 pound cat playing with it.
By James H. on March 6, 2016
Question:its weight ? thank you
Answer:Not sure of its exact weight but I'd say between 10 and 20 pounds definitely light weight.
By Fordgirl on October 11, 2014
Couple pounds...not too heavy, but solid enough for big kitten abuse.
By Michelle Andersen on October 11, 2014
I have no clue 10-15 lbs maybe.
By Jessica cook on October 12, 2014
doesn't weigh that much, I was able to put together in an afternoon!
By Bobbie W. on October 13, 2014
Question:Is this good for scratching or is one covered in carpet better than the faux fur?
Answer:My kitties use the posts for scratching. They bite, claw and pull them selves are around the structure with no problems. It is softer than carpet. So far it is holding up well to all the activity. They love the little thing.
By Suz on August 6, 2015
It has 2 scratching posts and one roller which is covered in rough rope and our cat LOVES to scratch it. Additionally it has the soft fur which ke lays on and rubs against. It's perfect!
By mary lynn on August 5, 2015
The sisal material on the posts is good for scratching on this cat tree.
By StateLineTack SELLER  on August 5, 2015
The posts and the "roller bar" on the front are wrapped in a twine material. My cat loves scratching those parts. We have had this cat condo for a few months and it is holding up nicely.
By mhysa3 on August 6, 2015
It's tiny really only good for a kitten my kids use it to
Play with their dolls was a waste of money
By Jabali_Cat on August 5, 2015
Question:How hard is it to put together?
Answer:It wasn't too hard. It came with a little tool to use and an instruction sheet. Most of it was premade and you just screwed the pieces together.
By Hannah Tharp on February 16, 2017
Not a problem. Very easy, good instructions. The cats love it. Not too large so it doesn't take up a great deal of room in the apartment.
By Angelo B. on February 18, 2017
It was very easy but unless your looking for a small scratching post I don't recommend this one it is very small not worth the money
By Amazon Customer on February 17, 2017
Easy to put together. Came with the needed tool.
By Amazon Customer on February 17, 2017
It was super easy to put together. Just lefty loosey righty tighty really
By Carleigh on February 16, 2017
Fairly easy
