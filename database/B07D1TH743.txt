I also have a 3 year old cat who is over 14 pounds and he has a little bit of an issue pulling himself up at times but he goes to the top nonetheless see less

Question:Is there a way to anchor this tree to the wall for stability?
Answer:Well. I guess if you are handy with a drill and have some basic carpentry skills you might. If you have some fairly long screws and can be sure to find a wall stud you might be able to go thru the side of one of the perches to anchor to a wall. How big and rambunctious are your cats?!?

I suppose with a strap you could anchor this - our two (large) cats love it

Question:Has anyone modified it so your cat could reach the top? Just received and my cat cannot maneuver herself to the top.
Answer:I would give your cat time to get used to it- maybe put some treats on the levels she can’t reach yet to encourage her. Cats are natural tree dwellers so your kitty just probably needs time to develop her natural skills

No modification needed. My cats had no problem reaching the top landing. If they can get to the tube they can climb out onto the top of it then up to the top landing pad.

None of my cats have a problem getting to the top. One was on the top sanding pad as I was putting it together.
