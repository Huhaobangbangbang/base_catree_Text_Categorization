Question:what sizes are the perches and the house?
Answer:I don't know the exact sizes, but the perches will hold two large cats. By large, I mean 15+ pounds lying side by side with no problem. The "bucket" and "hammock" things are especially popular with one of my small girls (6 pounds). She can curl up in there comfortably with room to spare. The house part holds my 20+ pounder very easily and comfortably. It's really a great tree house!! I love Armakat! see less

The top perch is 12 1/2" x 12" and the house is 19" x 13". I have 2 large cats over 12 pounds. They hang over the perches, but don't seem to mind. They love them. My youngest LOVES the "basket" at the top and can curl up in it. My older one loves to stretch out in the house. Neither liked the hammock, so I removed it and place a portable scratcher in that area. Hope this helps! I really like these cat trees and well worth the price, which is cheaper than most! see less

The house is 19.5 x 13.5 in. The two big perches are 22 x 20.5 in. and 22 x 17 in., the small one on the left 12 x 10 in. and the top perch approx. 13 x 13 in.
I have two very big adult cats (16 lbs.) and they both love this cat tree. They both use the house as well as the two big perches for sleeping, and they also use the scratch posts a lot. The tree is very sturdy and looks a lot nicer in our living room than anything we have seen in pet stores. see less

Perches vary in size, but all are big enough for any size cat. House is also big enough for any size cat. Our cat loves her tree!
