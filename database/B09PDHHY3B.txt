It can be removed without to much trouble. My cats didnâ€™t like it. They are to heavy and fell out of it. My daughters kitten likes it. So I gave it to her.

If you take off the top part, it can be removed. Or just skip the step of adding it completely during assembly

Question:Can a large 18lb cat fit comfortably?
Answer:I would say no. The tree is smaller than I expected. My 10lb cat barely fits in the hammock or bed.

I would say no, unfortunately. The top perch might fit the cat and the little closed in area would be fine for sure. But the hanging pouch fits my 7-8 lb cat pretty snuggly.

We have three cats and they have all been in the "cave" at the same time, so I would think an 18lb cat shouldn't have any issue there.
