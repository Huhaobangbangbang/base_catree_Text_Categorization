Get a dog. The dog will chase the cat up the tower and voila!

Cover it in catnip and put some treats on it and see if that helps. If he's an older cat, does he have trouble jumping that high? Some cats don't like perching up high. Yours might be one of them!

I think I would place some treats on the different levels, maybe catnip and if you have wand feather string they play with, then entice them around the cat tree. also placing in front of window, make sure it is not wobbly.

Question:my cat likes to rip off and eat the faux fur. Is that safe to consume? Also how do I deter that behavior without scaring the cat off the tower?
Answer:I have this tower and it's not faux fur. It's a good quality carpeting. My cat is a bit destructive but hasn't damaged anything on the tower. Some people say to spray a bit of Apple cider vinegar on items that cats like to chew. You might test this on an object in your home to see if he will still want to get on it. Good question...hope this helps. see less

Anything they eat that's non-edible can hurt them. The pieces can be hard to pass and cause future issues. Maybe getting one of those toys they have to Kick around to get the treat out to help distract them? Otherwise, it would just take time in training and possibly limiting their use until they learn.

you can make a cover with fabric and elastic or lay a folded towel over the platforms

Question:Where can I order another platform with the ridge around it for the cat tree I purchased?
Answer:From their website. It's almost as expensive as buying a new cat tree.

I would google the amarkat cat tree model to see if you are directed to the manufacturerâ€™s website .
By LAF on May 25, 2018
I would recommend calling Amazon and asking where you can get additional pieces to the cat tree. They should have the distributors name/address on file and you may be able to deal with them directly. Good Luck:)

Question:I'm searching everywhere for a way to keep my cat's food up high enough in the mudroom, away from our dogs. Will this work?
Answer:Might. If kitty is very small. The 2 top platforms aren't real big. Might work ok to place food in the center box. Center box is maybe 3 ft off the floor. If dogs are large enough to get up on hind legs then may not work there

Question:Some photos for the Armarkat B5301 53-Inch Cat Tree, Ivory have the ramp and some don't and are built slightly different - are there 2 options?
Answer:There are several Armarkat models. One to suite every need. You just have to pick the one that fits your need. This one had a top perch that came up to an octagonal window in the closet it is in. My cat can lay on the perch and look out the window. Her favorite place to take a nap.
