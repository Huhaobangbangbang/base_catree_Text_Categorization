Question:Is the hammock strong enough to hold a 19 lb cat?
Answer:My cat is 12-13 lbs, and it held her without any issues. It should hold the 19 lb cat. Just make sure you secure the hammock to the 2 posts real tight, and you shouldn't have any issues. This is real nice. Everything is very sturdy. I don't have any wobbly issue. It might be because I tightened each post real tight. The entire tree is very solid and sturdy. I recommend shopping around. I got mind at Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% coupon for a lot less. see less

I would think so. The top level is a little wobbly with my 11 pound cat so that's the only thing to worry about, but I don't see it breaking
