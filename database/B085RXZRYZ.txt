Question:Is the condo really 6.6inches by 5inches? It can't possibly that small right? Or is that the hole size? I want the full condo size
Answer:I think their dims are a little off...the condo itself is nice size. That is hole size. The ONLY downside to this is the top circular in my opinion. My cat is fine with it as she’s small (little over 5lbs) but this not for a bigger kitty or multiple cats in my opinion.

It’s not that small. My cats only use the top of the condo.
