Question:Is the cat included?
Answer:Of course-what use is a condo without a cat? However, the only way the cat will use the condo is if you place it on the kitchen counter.

Yes, but some assembly required, and the instructions are unclear. I'm still waiting on software update since mine won't stop racing around the house at 3am, and makes noises if it can see the food bowl is empty. Surely there should be an update disk included. 2 out of 5 stars.

Yes, however the cat was missing one leg. Tripod has nevertheless given us many hours of amusement using his cat condo.

Mine came with TWO! Both are community cats that love to roam the streets, but the record breaking cold had them moving this contraption indoors!!

Yes, it comes with a large fat cat that needs some bug fixes. Too bad I can‚Äôt return this one, because it keeps glitching. No matter how hard I try to program it to sleep at night and play during the day, it seems it must be broken as I‚Äôve tried this numerous times. Nah lol but I‚Äôm so ordering this, these replies are h‚Ä¶ see more

Question:What's the maximum cat size/weight that the hammock will accommodate? Mine is 17 lbs, loves hammocks but can't find one big enough.
Answer:I recommend the Grepatio version for large cats. My (large) Ragdoll lives in his and he‚Äôs very comfortable in it. It seems to be not just bigger than this one in diameter but has a lot more material in the bowl, so he can sink all the way into it. Also very sturdy, as he jumps into it from below and it barely moves.

The hammock held my 25lb cat, he was just too big to be comfortable, he would overhang on the sides.

Yes definitely but might I recommend installing some steel support bracing and a shelf so he doesn't have to go very far to eat.

Question:What's the maximum cat size/weight that the hammock will accommodate? Mine is 17 lbs, loves hammocks but can't find one big enough.
Answer:Our 13 lb cat fits perfectly. Our 17 cat is too big, but still sleeps in it and loves it!

my cat weighs 25 lbs, this is too small for him, I gave mine away to my niece. The hammock did hold my cat, he was just too big to be comfortable, he hung over the sides.

Question:Does this come assembled?
Answer:No. It is so simple to assemble though!!
By Bridget on September 14, 2019
No. It comes in 4 pieces. You just have to screw everything together. It only took a few minutes. Was very simple.
By JMommaLuvsBubs on September 14, 2019
No it doesn‚Äôt come assembled but it very easy to assemble. My 9 year old put it together quickly. It is 3 pieces.
By krepaal on September 14, 2019
No this does not. The assembly is fairly easy though.
By Amazon Customer on September 14, 2019
No, but it's very easy to assemble. Took me less than 5 minutes. I had to replace mine after only 4 months though because all the "fur" fell out of it and ended up all over my house!
By Brooklynn on September 15, 2019
Question:How much can it hold? I love my cat, but he weighs around 20lb or a bit more..
Answer:My cat weighs 14.6 lbs. he fills the whole hammock. I measured the inside at 14.5 inches.
Check out the furhaven pet cat hammock. The dimensions are bigger.
By Catsagt on June 23, 2019
My cat is 17 lbs and barely fits in this. I‚Äôve caught him sleeping in it only once, but it‚Äôs his favorite scratching post. Better that than my furniture.
By Kristeane Benavides on June 23, 2019
Our bigger cat doesn't fit in the hammock, although I'm sure it would hold his weight.
By LauraH on June 23, 2019
The perch is suspended on a piece of metal that reminds me of a basketball hoop. Your big boy won't have much extra room, but the thing is like a hammock of soft fabric seen into the good sized circular metal. Should keep him from falling out! He will like the height advantage. My boy is about 16 lbs. and has room to roll over (he is young and lithe still) see less

Question:Are the replacement toys (the fluffy white ball) available somewhere?
Answer:It looks like it could be. My cat chewed off the part below the insert. I do want to try and look for a replacement. The little latch part does indicate that you can replace the toy. Otherwise it would just be one long bungee string
By Kindle Customer on January 9, 2019
I found these and it looks like it will fit.

It comes with an extra ball

Question:How large is the one with two post and hammock? I have limited space but tired of single post falling over.
Answer:The base is 16‚Äù square. It‚Äôs 20‚Äù tall. 21‚Äù across the top from post to post. Very sturdy too.
By Avid Reader on September 18, 2019
I do not know. The one we got, the 3 post scratcher, is very small. Too small for the cat. Look at the measurement for the base and that will tell you the size of the footprint.
By MandBinc on September 18, 2019
About 2 feet high....however it's a great option for something your cat can scratch and lay in and it really doesnt take up much floor space at all!
By Andrea on September 18, 2019
It‚Äôs about 20wx20h.
By Wanda Brown on September 23, 2019
Question:What size are the screws? M8 or M10?
Answer:the screws have allen heads and they are quite thick, so i'm going with the #10, it did come with the allen wrench
By D B on January 18, 2022
Question:Do you sell just the hammock part separately? I bought this 3 months ago and my kitties have made a hole in the bed
Answer:Not sure if sold separately, but it can be handmade very easily
By Cotton Candy on September 26, 2021
Question:What is the weight?
Answer:Yes, the total weight is about 9 pounds.
