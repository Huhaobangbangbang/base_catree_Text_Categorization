Question:Can I please get the deminsions of the perches and the box? For V high base. Thank you.
Answer:The top perch is 22"x11", lower perch is 22"x11" and the box is 15"x15"x15". This cat tree is the best I've ever seen and very affordable. Very well made, sturdy and the perches are covered with these amazing memory foam pads. I wash them in a lingerie bag on a gentle cycle and they come out looking like new. It had a very modern look to it - not a giant ugly carpet covered monster. Highly recommend by both me and my cat! see less

Estimating the top to be about 18 x 10, the lower one is an odd shape, maybe 10 inches across. We were disappointed with the furry patches that attach to the unit, so I cut carpets to fit and stapled them down. Now the cats like it a lot.

Question:Is the rope made of sisal?
Answer:As the others have said, the rope is made of seagrass. My cats like to scratch, and that loosened up the rope fairly quickly. If you catch it early, you can probably glue it back. You can also buy replacement posts on catit.com

Sea grass. It's smoother and less "prickly" than sisal and has a nice smell.
By Karen on February 23, 2016
No, their website lists it as "sea grass", but in terms of texture it is very much like sisal.

Question:Was this made in China?
Answer:I don't know if it was or not, but it was not a very good product. The directions weren't very well thought out.

Question:Can I buy replacement tubes
Answer:Looking at this right now. I couldn't find any here on Amazon (quick search) but I found some on the catit.com website. Still need to check if they're the right match though.

Question:The reported dimensions in the descriptions seem completely off. What are the actual dimensions of the base?
Answer:I was confused by the demensions also .
But they are close. It’s because they are listing the demensions of each individual piece instead of the entire thing put together.
The base is actually 22 x22
Once you put it together the little box for the cat to sleep in is 14 1/2 square .
And the entire piece is 33” high .
It is heavy and very sturdy . I have 5 cats and 3 if them use this constantly . The pad for them to sit in is very comfortable.
They take turns sitting and looking out the window . My one cat ( who loves it and spends all night on it watching out the window ),is 18lbs . I am usually concerned about him knocking something over but this is amazing !
He jumps up and it doesn’t budge. He’s very rough and the only thing he has managed to take apart on it are the 2 little toys that were attached by string . He had them off within one day and now just chases them around the house. We have had this for about 3 months .
It is also very attractive everyone comments on it . It is in our living room . I have been thinking of buying the larger one too now that I have seen how sturdy it is and just how well made it is in general .
Also no carpet debris on the floor like normal scratchers .
I’m fanatically clean so it’s perfect . see less
