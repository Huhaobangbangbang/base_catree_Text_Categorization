Question:How long will it last?
Answer:The condo itself will last but the sisal rope is terrible. Within 3 months mine started "shedding" 2-3 inch pieces of rope which is a choking hazard for the cats. Plus the platforms are too small even for my 10 lb cat. So, I would spend a bit more and get a better one.

Question:Can i get replacement posts? mine are losing their rope
Answer:They don't offer replacement sisal posts. You just have to buy sisal and replace it yourself. It goes on easily with a hot glue gun and some patience.

Replacing the rope is super easy honest. Its usually hot glued on or stapled. As it starts to frey you can use hair clippers to trim it back if the cats are gnawing on it. Once it breaks off and unwinds. Simply buy new rope. Your looking for nautral manila or sisal rope please note... ABSOLUTELY NO SYNTHETIC. Reason be‚Ä¶ see more

Yes. Order direct from the manufacturer. They're not cheap since they don't have a special rate on the shipping but saves you buying a whole new tree. Quick tip: when you notice the rope wearing out towards the top of the post, turn it around so the rope at the bottom is at the top. The posts will last twice as long.

Maybe, I've never seen them. The first time or two that happens each post I use a hot glue gun and rewind it. I find that holds just as well again for awhile until it needs it again, after the third time or so I figure it's time to start looking for a new one again

I'm not sure. I usually just replace the rope when needed.

Question:Diameter of the bed areas?
Answer:Mike: all the areas are different sizes. I have an average size cat who sleeps comfortably on every level and in every nook. I wouldn't get this for a maine coon, however.

2 pedistals are about 12x12 inches, top box is also 12x12 and bottom box is 18x12. This is a nice tree and has served our seven... yes seven (ridiculous I know) cats well for about a year now. We have huge cats. Of course with that many cats, the ropes don't last long (better the ropes than my furniture!) but it is still pretty sturdy and they sleep/play on it all the time. We have 3 cat trees in the house, they are all good. My cats love them. see less

Question:does it come with an anchor to secure to wall for tipping purpose?
Answer:No it does not, but we had a 20 pound weight from my son laying around so we put that on the bottom and it works perfect. Our cats run up it and it is not an issue with the weight there.

Question:How high is it to the 3rd tier platform and how high to the lower bed?
Answer:Counting the bottom tier platform that sits on the floor and the (2) houses and their tops. The total height of the cat condo is approx. (5'7") which is the top tier platform. The bottom tier platform is on the floor and the top of the bottom house which is on the bottom tier platform is (1') high from the floor. The 2nd tier platform is (1'11") from the floor which has the 2nd house on it and it's top is (2'9") from the floor. The 3rd tier platform which is above the 2nd house is (3'4") from the floor. The 4th tier platform is (4'1") from the floor and the top tier platform as I said earlier is (5'7") from the floor. I hope this helps you. My cats love the towers and use all the tier's. Just as a side note, I would recommend tightening the tower(s) at least once a month as with lots of use depending on the amount of cats you have the platforms will loosen. I'm very pleased with the towers I purchased and I'm sure your cats will love the towers. see less
