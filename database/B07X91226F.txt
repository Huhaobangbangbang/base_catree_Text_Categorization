Question:I have been shopping cat trees for weeks. These 11.8 x 15.7 platforms are so unusually small. Are they really that small? Typo?
Answer:Yes . the size of platforms is 11.8 x 15.7inch
By Hey brother SELLER  on July 1, 2021
I have 2 normal sized cats and they don't seem to have any problems. My cats love the tree & are in it daily. I like the fact that there are areas for them to sleep, look out the window, & it even has a small cave. That was the first thing 1 of my cats explored. So I am very happy with the product.
By B. Federman on July 7, 2021
Yes, I just measured them the size is accurate. With the padding and material they're 12"x16". These are actually about an inch or two bigger than the platforms on my last cat tree.

Question:Could one of the hammocks be attached on the front instead of the side? I know it can be put together with just one, but its too wide. Thanks
Answer:Sorry ,You can't just install one basket, because this will cause the left and right sides of the whole cat tree to be different heights
By Hey brother SELLER  on December 14, 2021
I owned this product for over a year and my cats love it. I measured the distance between the posts on the side and the posts in the front. They are both 13 1/2 inches. So I believe you could put one in the front while you‚Äôre putting it together. They do not go on at the end. I hope this helps you.
By Amazon Customer on December 13, 2021
I believe you can. I measured and it‚Äôs the same distance pole to pole.

Question:How tall is the cube and what is the length from front to back? I'm putting this between a toilet and bathtub. Thanks!
Answer:I don‚Äôt think this pet condo will fit in that space unless it‚Äôs very large. The cube is 13 inches in the front and about 12 inches on the side. But the slings go on the side so the total width of the product is About 35 inches. I hope this helps you.
