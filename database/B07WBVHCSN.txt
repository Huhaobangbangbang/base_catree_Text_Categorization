Question:What are the pads made of? (my cat loves this tree so much she won't use the other ones lol. I think its the texture of the pads she likes)
Answer:I'm not sure just what the material is. The inside is a firm rubber pad, and the outside soft but reminds me of sofa material. Unfortunately my cat loves is also but uses it as a scratch pad. He can stand on his back legs and stretch up to the top of the little house part and just scratch all day long if I let him but so far the material has held up. Sorry I can't help any more than that. see less

Question:Does your cat actually use the "massage arc"?
Answer:Not so far. I tried to show him how it works and he wanted nothing to do with it. But then he took a long time to figure out how the house worked and the perch on top. He finally gets on top and likes to lay there and watch the cars go by the house and last summer I found him inside the house a couple times when the sun hit the porch. So I won't be surprised if he starts using the massage arc this coming summer. see less
