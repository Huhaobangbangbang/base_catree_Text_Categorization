18" to first platform and another 18 to the top. I keep this one in the window with an east facing. My cats love it in the morning for sunning and watching the world go by. Hope this helps

Question:what are the dimensions of the little house at the bottom?
Answer:It's about 11 inches across and about 11 1/2 inches tall. My cat is a little on the heavy side, my roommates cat is a Mainecoon. Both cats fit in it comfortably. Now they haven't both gotten in it at the same time, but by themselves they both seem to enjoy it. I like the material it is made from, because it's soft like a cats fur. see less

Too small for our cat, we use it to store his toys. Interior dimension is about 1" larger than a salad plate in diameter.

Question:Where is there a cat bed on this image? it cannot be on top and how wide is the top piece, please?
Answer:This image is not the item I bought. Mine has the brown on the top with a cat silloquette as the door to the lower part. The top on mine is technically the cat bed. It has a bit of extra padding and the raised sides. It's about 15 1/2 in across at the widest.

There is not a bed on this one, just the bottom round box. The top piece is almost 12 inches. My cats both weigh 11+lbs, when they sit on it there's not much room. When they lay on it they hang off of it. I worry about it tipping over when they play, but so far no falls. Looks like the tower should have been placed over the bed box. see less

I wouldn't say there is a "bed" per say.. it's more of a felted platform. The top part is pretty small but my 12 pound cat sits up there and lays up there and absolutely loves it.
By Amazon Customer on December 6, 2017
Top piece 12 inch diameter. My cat sleeps on top and middle. Plays all over.

Question:I purchased this one several years ago (my cat loves it), but he has shreaded the lower post. Can I purchase just a replacement post?
Answer:Probably not; 1/4-1/8" thick jute cord can be found from a number of locations, and used to re-wrap cat posts. It can be secured at the top, bottom, and every several inches using small tacks along with a strong adhesive like Gorilla Glue, with stripes of glue along the tube to further hold the cord as its wrapped.

For that you wod have to contact the main company's customer service number. Should be able to google the company to get that.
