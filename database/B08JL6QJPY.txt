Question:Are you just supposed to tie the ramp on or what?
Answer:Dear customer, yes, you can tie the ramp on, or just put it beside the platform，because almost the adult cats jump up the platform without the ramp, thanks.

That is what I did. There are two loops under the base piece so I slipped the two pieces on the ladder through them and then tied them together.

I have a 16 pounder and it seems pretty stable when he’s on it. I just purchased this 2 weeks ago. not sure in the long run how it’ll hold up, so far so good.

Question:Are you able to provide a replacement part (the little wheel)? It arrived broken...
Answer:Try contacting the seller directly. The metal part that went to my wheel was also broken, but it didnt really matter to me, because it still fit on there and the cats dont play with it. But if you want a replacement, you'll have to contact the amazon seller directly.

Question:Is the color blue or purple? The pictures look purple on my screen but I'm seeing a lot of references to blue/navy/indigo.
Answer:Dear Kelly
Yes, the color is blue
By HYABI PET SELLER  on May 19, 2021
The color is cream and blue. Careful ordering this item. I had to change the way I put it together because some pieces I received weren't the correct pieces.
By Kim Dotson on May 18, 2021
It’s blue but it’s definitely not a deep blue. I can see how it might appear a smidge purple but it’s blue.
