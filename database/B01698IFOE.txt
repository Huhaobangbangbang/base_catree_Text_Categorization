Question:Where is this product manufactured?
Answer:I'm not sure. It's not listed on the actual product. Warning though, it's not very good quality. My guess is China.

Have no idea. Probably China. I put it together. It was satisfactory. Purtches were small for the size of my cats.

Question:What is the dimensions on the two top perches
Answer:We loved this for a time - both our cats played (got wild), slept, and looked out at the birds through the window. It is however suitable for kittens. Even our smallest cat who is very petite, needed something larger within a year. We no longer have it, but I would estimate only 10" maybe 12" square, tops. They are pressed board covered in a thin fabric; not a heavy carpet like you see in pet stores that are very costly. No padding, not even around the inch high frame. But it's easy to recover them. You can add batting, wrap with fabric of your choice and use a stable gun; but kittens grow quickly, so unless money is tight, I would suggest looking for something that has 14-15". The are out there - you will spend more upfront, but your kittens will grow and still be comfortable. You will notice after looking carefully, that all the pictures on the affordable priced condos only showcase them with kittens. We later bought two with larger surfaces over two years ago. They are not as tall but will last for many more years. see less

Question:Is the total height 50” or 66” ?
Answer:Dimensions read 50 - don't have anymore. Be sure to carefully look at pictures of the animals in the ads as most are really made for kittens only. Both of our cats played hard on this when they were kittens and they loved the height to gaze out the window, but they did quickly grow out of it.

Question:What are the diameters of the 2 highest rest areas?
Answer:Are the top 2 rest areas really 2 feet by 2 feet? There are complaints in the reviews about them being too small. But that seems plenty big?
