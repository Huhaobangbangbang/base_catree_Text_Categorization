Question:Would this be sturdy enough for a 16lb cat?
Answer:Most likely but I think it would depend on what your cat would be doing. If your cat is really rambunctious it might not be the best for them. I had twenty pounds of kitten (four five pound kittens) using it at once, going nuts and running all over it, jumping around and it's held up fine. But five pounds of pressure in a spot over sixteen is a pretty good jump. I'd need to find the documentation but I believe the weight limit is 20-25 pounds. see less

I have 4 cats and they all play on it. They’re 10lbs each or more. I would order the 3rd section to this if I had more room for it.
