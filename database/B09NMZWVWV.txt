Question:Has anyone had a problem with a cat tipping over when scratching or being unstable? Thanks!
Answer:I have a big cat, about 24 lbs. Cats love to use it as a starting point for jumping to the top of our
entertainment center, and cats scratch it too. Never even leaned to one side.
It's very, very sturdy.

This is not very heavy, but it doesn’t tip over. It might slide a little on an uncarpeted floor.
