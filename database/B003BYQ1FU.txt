Question:What do you consider a small cat??
Answer:We have a petite cat that it works perfect for, but our "fat cat" not so much. keep in mind the whole stand is only aprox 29" tall (from bottom to top of cave), the top platform is only 11x11Â½, the bottom platform even smaller, the "cave" is only 8" tall, 8" deep and 11" wide, and it's curved which take away some room (take a piece of notebook paper and cut off the corners to shape it in an arch and you get the idea.)
Our small cat is skinny and lanky, maybe 7" tall if I had to guess. Hope this helps! see less

Question:How far apart are the two steps, and how high is the first step off the ground? (I have a kitten with mobility issues.)
Answer:The first step is 10-12 inches from the floor, the second step is 8-10 inches from the first step. Our kitten jumps and climbs all over it.he is very hyper and loves it... the older cats are not really interested... I hope this helps

Fleece and Georgie the Cat loves it for looking out the window and scratching.

It's more of a fleece but it's not very thick.

Textured fleece like inexpensive bath mats. Great tree for a smaller cat. My cat loves it.

Question:does this contain catnip or anything other then wood and feece
Answer:I don't think the hanging ball contained catnip. My guys love this....tho they did tear the ball off within one day. IIt cleans up beautifully....they use it daily

No catnip but my girls love to lay on top and hide their heads in the opening.
By Bobbie on December 4, 2014
Nope no catnip but it's smaller than it looks in the picture. If you have a kitten this is fine but if you have a adult cat it could get tricky.

Question:Would his work for a 6 pound bunny who doesn't have full jumping capabilities?
Answer:Definitely will work. My cat is 10 pounds. Took a little while for her to adjust to it but she loves it. Blue is my favorite color Your bunny will be able to jump onto the shorter platform and perhaps later she can use the "house" one. Good Luck.

If the bunny doesn't have full jumping capabilities then it isn't going to be able to get from the base to the upper levels of the tree and enjoy the exercise from doing so. I don't see how this would work for the bunny in its present state.
By Brenda Woodward Grisham on October 29, 2016
From floor to first level is 11 inches to second level is 9 inches from first level to second. The first level can be changed to give a better landing. If bunny grows to much it will end up too small.
