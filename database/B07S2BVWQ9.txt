Question:Please what are the heights of the top two viewing areas so I know if more than one cat can look out the window?
Answer:The top level is 41" from the floor. The mid level top of the box is 32" from the floor. Our cat loves it. When he's getting into trouble, all we have to do is say "CAT TREE!", and instantly he's sitting on the top level, looking very innocent. When it's cool, he likes to curl up in the cat hammock. This tree is sturdy, stable, and heavier than you would think. Our 13 lb. cat jumps from the floor to the top, and hasn't toppled it over. It comes with a wall anchor strap, but we have not had to use it.

Hello: I measured from the floor to the center flat area, 32" inches to the very top 43" inches. Hope this helps. My cats love this from the bottom to the top!

I'm at work at the moment, but it is about 4' high and roomy at the top. Plenty of room for more than one cat at the top, and my cats share the top all the time to watch the birds out the window. So the next ones down are around 2' high.

Question:Can the hammock be switched to another pole?
Answer:No. The cat hammock is mounted between two short sections of scratch poles that make up the longest support/scratch pole. The hammock can be adjusted about 180 degrees to the left or right, which ever suits the location of the cat tree.
By David G on January 23, 2022
Not that I can see, if you're handy you might be able to cut it and move it to another pole but I wouldn't try it my self.
By S. Czoschke on May 17, 2020

By Alfred G. Schuller on May 26, 2020
