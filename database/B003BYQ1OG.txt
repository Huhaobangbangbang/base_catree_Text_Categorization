Question:what are the dimensions of the bed on top?
Answer:The actual size is 13" x 13" but there is a 1/2 inch lip around the bed so where the cat lays inside is 12" x 12". I have a large cat about 15 pounds and plenty of room for her.

Question:Can you tell me what the dimensions of the two top posts that the cat would lay on? Thanks
Answer:The one that. I have is slightly different than the one that's pictured. The top circular platform is about. a foot in diameter.there's another top area that's like an oversized sock that a smaller cat could lay in that's approximately ten inches in diameter. Hope that helps

Question:Would this be a good tree for a large cat?
Answer:I guess it depends if you mean a fat cat or just large in size, or both. The biggest of my brood is about 17 pounds. I was actually looking for a tree to accommodate the 17 lb guy and another about 13 lbs. The others are a bit smaller. My 13 lb buddy is kind of large in physical, meaning he is tall cause he has very long legs. These 2 play really hard on it fighting/playing. They take running leaps and hit it full force. I'm surprised they haven't broken it cause they did a different one. I do have a cat weighing 22 lbs but he doesn't play on it cause he's pretty old, 17 yrs. He does fit well in the cubby on the bottom which I was hoping he would. The little shelf above the cubby is about 18x13, the shelf above that is about 18x18 and the bed on top is 14x14 with little sides on it. The 2 babies I mentioned sleep together in the bed. The cubbie at the bottom is decent size. It measures 22x22x13 high. I am thinking about screwing the whole thing to a board about 24x24 just to stabilize it. I'm afraid when they hit it full force they could tip it cause its so tall. But it really is a very heavy unit. see less

under 40lbs would be good. I really like my armarkat cat tree. I have three cats and they love.... it. I researched which one was the best and armarkat company came in second, first was way to expensive. They are also very affordable. My husband put together in no time and said about the quality was really good... Get it!!!!!! see less

My cats are both about 16 pounds and it works fine for them. It will rock a bit when they jump from the floor all the way to the top pedestal but so far it has not tipped over.

The one i bought isn't what's shown in the pic. I bought the one with the house on the second level and two perchs. However I have 2 six month old kittens weighing in a 9# each. So far things are working out...but idk about in another six months. BUT it's pretty sturdy. I'm glad I bought it. Hopes this helps!

Question:Is this tree study. I have two cats and one loves to climb
Answer:Yes, it is. I have 2 cats, and one is a large cat, and they love to chase each other up & down the tower. No matter what crazy stuff they do the tower still stands!

I bought a different armarkat cat tree, but yes mine is 5 ft high and very sturdy. My 1 year old cat is extremely hyper and loves to climb and hang off of it, and it only wobbles a little bit of he catapults off of it haha. I definitely recommend it.
By Jamie Shepard on August 1, 2016
Yes, it's very stable. One of my cats weighs 18 lbs. and he climbs on it. Neither of my cats has used the top tier yet but both use it at the same time.
By Rhetta on August 1, 2016
It is very sturdy! Our cat is pretty aggressive as well. It is his favorite spot in a whole house.
By Rozaliya Subkhangulova on August 1, 2016
My cats love it. They sleep on it. They weight around 18pounds each.

I find my tree very sturdy. When my large, heavy cat jumps up from shelf to shelf to get to the top platform, the tree rocks just a little, but never gets close to the point that it could topple over. Note that I have the tree model that has the little "house" with a pair of arched doors on the second level, not on the bottom, as is pictured here. But I'd think that a model with the enclosed "house" on the bottom would be even sturdier, if anything. see less

Question:My cat has destroyed the 23" scratching post. Is there replacement parts ? I would hate to have to buy another house because of that one post.
Answer:I don't have the instructions any more, but I seem to recall you can order them. Try googling the Amarkat company. Beyond that, I don't know.
