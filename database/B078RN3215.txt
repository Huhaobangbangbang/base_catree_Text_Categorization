It is very small. I have 2 Maine coons and they never could fit in the enclosures. Anything other than a kitten could not use the hammock or enclosures.

Absolutely. Mine are 2 years old and approximately 15 lbs each, and it definitely supports them both. If post a picture of them both sleeping on it if I could.

Answer:Dear Customer,
Please don't worry, all the material we used are selected, the cardboard are CARB P2 grade environmental board, sisal rope are natural sisal, fabric covering are high quality polyester.If there is some smell, probably it is caused during the long sea transportation in sealed package. We recommend you put the item in some ventilated area for some days.Hope it can help you.
If you have any other question or requirement, please feel free to contact us.
Sincerely,

I haven't had any issues with this condo and my cats love it! Maybe try reinforcing it using washers where the screws are in addition for more support

You have had yours about 11 months longer than me. I wouldn't have any idea that would help you. If its really bad, it could tip over and damage your wall or funiture. You may want to consider buying a new one. A new one is less expensive than repairing or painting a wall.
