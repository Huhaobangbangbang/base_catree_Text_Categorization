Question:Is the base actually designed to be put into a corner or can it sit flush against a wall?
Answer:Ours does sit in the corner but you could put just one side flush against the wall. The base might stick out more that way but when assembling you can twist the shelves to work better for the space

I have mine in a corner next to a window. Being triangular I feel that it fits better in a corner, but I don't have it flush with the walls. I do like this cat tree, but the picture makes it appear wider than it is. My 12 year old has a hard time getting up to the big box towards the top because it doesn't have staggered steps. The base is relatively small and the platforms are pretty much on top of each other, so younger cats get up and down more easily, but they mostly have to jump down, and it's pretty tall and seems rough. I think they had a great idea when making it, but it could use a bit of a design change. see less

hi this cat tree will sit flush to the wall in a corner or not. either will work
By Dava Bliss on February 28, 2015
It's designed to fit into the corner and is most stable there.
By Tami & Jeremy on September 15, 2015
We were very unhappy. Was way to wobbly. The one Costco sells is so much better

Question:Is the base run 30in in both directions against the wall and 45in deep from the corner? Or is it 30in along the wall one way and 45in in another?
Answer:Without measuring it, my guess is that both sides of the triangle are 30 in and the opposite curved edge is 45! My cats love it still- it’s their go-to! I have it in front of a big window and they climb, sleep and play there everyday!

Question:Will it hold a 40+ pound cat?
Answer:Well, my indoor kitties are way less than 40lbs. We made a few adjustments to the house. We put the small house on top and one of the platforms where the small house is shown. The pole holding the small house in the picture is a bit wobbly. It is does not seem like it will break, but you know cats do not like wobbly things to climb on. The basket would be too small for such a tiger. The top part and other platforms should be just fine. The big house would fit your cat for sure. Our female seems to enjoy it the most. She sleeps in the hammock a lot. We are still getting them used to it and they still wind up on the chairs more often than I would like. I plan to hide treats in it to see if I can entice them to use it more often. They do like the scratching post, which are everywhere on it. see less

A 40 pound cat?? Check again...if it doesn't have a lot of fur then it's probably a child.
By Paul G. on September 27, 2016
I think that only the big house would work. The little house isn't supported well-enough for even 6 pound cats. The small platforms on top would be too small and the cat would just end up breaking them off-they're becoming a little loose even with my house cats. I wouldn't get this. I'd check into a more substantial cat tree from Drs. Foster and Smith. But even that may not be enough. We have a local builder who makes cat trees to order, perhaps there is someone in your area who does the same. see less
By Kindle Customer on July 22, 2015
Way too wobbly for a cat that size. Our thirteen pound cat finds it flimsy
By Mad Mag on July 8, 2015
Yes I believe it will. This is made with strong materials.
By Jim Shavalian on July 8, 2015
Yes, it shouldn't be a issue.
By TSC Shops SELLER  on July 8, 2015
Yes my tigers love it..
By Matthew Salmond on December 6, 2017
Question:How do you think this would hold up against 2 very large (15 pounds) very active cats?
Answer:I have 6 cats. My big guys are 17+. It is incredibly well put together. I'm an RVT and pretty cynical. I have been telling all my friends what a great tree this is.
By Sherrie Nanney on August 10, 2015
Very well. We have 5 cats, only one who is your size, a couple that are close, but 2 who are fairly active and chase each other into, off of, up, and down it.
By Tami & Jeremy on September 15, 2015
They will make it wobble but I doubt they could tip it over. If you're able to put it in a corner that would sure it up. My cat weights about 10 pounds and it handles him no problem, even at the top.
By Donald Kalakosky on August 10, 2015
I'm not sure. Do you own a power drill? If the screws are in tight, it should be able to hold the weight. I ended up making two towers instead of one mainly because my chinchilla likes jumping back and forth between the two. The nice thing about this cat tree is it doesn't have to look exactly like the picture.
By LaShante Boyd on August 10, 2015
Very well. Have a big boy myself who is a scratching post monster. We separated the top hide house from the rest of the structure due to it being too high, but he loves the top shelf. T
Best part is the tree is with a bit of ingenuity flexible in design.

Question:Is the house solid walls or fabric stretched over skeleton frame?
Answer:The cat tree is solid walled. Problem I had with it is my cat's are 14 and 16 pounders and the tree is just not sturdy enough for them. So they would'nt play on it. They got on it twice then it just took up space.
By Nancy C. on December 20, 2017
Solid walls

Question:I have a savannah kitten and am looking for a sturdy tree. I've noticed this one doesn't push against the ceiling will it be sturdy enough?
Answer:I have a very large, long cat that refuses to use this tree because of the wobble. It can be tightened or loosened to the stability you like, but it will always sit a bit off the wall and rock. If your savannah kitten grows large, it may not like it later on. For smaller cats it works just fine. There are other, more expensive trees that sit on the wall and can rise to the ceiling, but you'll pay for size and not quality with them. I think this tree is great quality and sturdy, you just need to find the right spot for it. I anchored mine to the wall with straps, but even without them it won't fall over. see less
By Belthozar on August 15, 2015
I have 6 cats that use this cat tree and it doesn't rock or move. And my babies run all over it
By Crystal Glasheen on August 13, 2015
We put ours in a corner -- 3 cats and no issues -- the base is large enough that it is sturdy
By Janice on August 13, 2015
My two youngest cats will jump the gate that is on the other side of the room, fly through the air, and land on it. And it's still standing. You could always add an "L" shaped bracket or two to the platform that holds the "house". By "L" shaped bracket, I mean these: http://smile.amazon.com/Stanley-Hardware-75-6104-Corner-Braces/dp/B00004Z0PL/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1442357401&sr=8-5&keywords=l+bracket see less
By Tami & Jeremy on September 15, 2015
My cats still leap and launch themselves off of it! It does wobble some but not close to tipping over. It has caused me no case to worry.

Question:What are the post made of? I have a tree and the posts are cardboard tubes that eventually tear on the ends.
Answer:The posts are made of cardboard.
By TSC Shops SELLER  on July 16, 2015
Yes the posts are cardboard tubes

Question:How much weight can this hold at one time? I have 8 cats each weighing anywhere btwn 10-20#s. Is it sturdy?
Answer:We've had all 5 of our cats on the tree at the same time. Their weight is: 8, 10, 10, 12, 15. It handled it well.
By Tami & Jeremy on September 15, 2015
I wouldn't trust it with that many at once. The cat tree itself is pretty sturdy, (except for the bottom cubbie, which broke off in a week for me) but I would be more worried about it being too top heavy and tipping over.
By Phil on July 18, 2015
It is pretty sturdy. I do have it against a wall and one of my cats likes to jump or lung onto the middle section and you can hear it bang against the wall but not that bad.
By Kitty Readle on July 18, 2015
No it is wobbly and the lowest box would never tighten properly, so stripped out within a couple months. I took out the stripped piece and put the box back on lower and it's working for now. It's also made of material, NOT carpet, so the fabric is shredding on the floor daily. The hanging mice broke off the first 2-3 days my 3 baby kittens played on it. My cats love it, but it's certainly not the quality I'd hoped for. see less
By Donna Russell on July 18, 2015
I would not recommend this cat tree for larger cats.
By TSC Shops SELLER  on July 20, 2015
I definitely would not recommend this cat tree for large cats.

Question:Is the material on this carpet, or plush/'fur-like'?
Answer:Plush/Fur. Or the softest carpet ever. I have white (mostly) cats and it gets covered in hair so fast. I cat brush gets most of it out. So better than with carpet I think.
By Brittany N. on January 6, 2015
I would say plush/fur like. It is much softer than my carpets.
By Jaycie kite on January 6, 2015
Fur like carpet mix lol sorry it's not "carpet" carpet and it's not fur like either
Very soft, nice
By Jamie Williams on January 6, 2015
I own this I have multiple cats they love it!!!! The material is actually furlike but short plush. I hope I was of help.
By Tamra on January 8, 2015
It is a plush. Very soft. Holds up well under my 3 girls. Easy to take care of. Looks really nice also.
By Jami Shelton on January 6, 2015

Question:In my apartment we can't have pets, so is the box inconspicuous enough that you can't tell what's inside?
Answer:Says Best Pets on the box
By Amazon Customer on April 5, 2016
Sorry I honestly don't recall what outside of box looked like
By Paula A. Mueller on April 4, 2016
It is labeled to what it is, so no it's not.
By Duhnecie on April 4, 2016
Question:what kind of screws come with the cat tower?
Answer:They are already built into the pieces which makes an easy assembly you just screw then all together. And some misc screws to tighten a few pieces on.. but i can't remember . I can take a picture tmorrow and post if it helps👍
By nl on September 10, 2017
Hex key, and the key comes with it. I recommend however that you purchase a hex key set, because they will always come in handy and there are many different sizes.
By donna louis on September 10, 2017
When my cat jumps onto this cat tree it is not stable.
By James White on September 10, 2017
It is assembled with bolts.
By Dale Watson on September 10, 2017
Question:From the ground up to the large 'house', how tall is that?
Answer:This one in my HO is not safe for cats. I took mine back apart and sent it back. The pressed wood is cheap and the faux fur is about as thick as toilet tissue. I have always been happy with the condos purchased , but this one is ridiculous. Definitely not made with the cat in mind. Straight up with no perches to make climbing easy. Once to the top...the cat must jump or try to climb down ....which is impossible. If children are in the home I would worry about it falling if not anchored to the wall. I would be very afraid to have my cats trying to use this on a daily basis. This one is not worth the time it took to make it. Also not for a large cat. Heaven help a kitten that climbs it. DANGEROUS see less
