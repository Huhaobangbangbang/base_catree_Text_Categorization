Question:Will these damage the walls of my apartment? (Security deposit)
Answer:Yes. You have to drill through the drywall into the studs inside the wall to get the required attachment. The set can be removed and screw holes will remain. Minor patchwork will fix the holes.

Question:the description says it comes with two ladders, but only one is depicted; which is correct?
Answer:Hello. Thank you for your question and I apologize for the confusion. There are 2 Ladder Pieces that come with the complex. Those Ladder Pieces are for the one ramp section (ladder section).

Question:How do you remove cloth for cleaning?
Answer:The fabric is held by two pieces - the mounting plank bottom (installed into your wall) and the top piece. You can simply remove the top piece by uninstalling the two screws, which will allow you to lift the fabric free. We recommend machine-washing with a cold, gentle cycle and hang-drying to keep the fabric from shrinking or becoming frayed. see less
