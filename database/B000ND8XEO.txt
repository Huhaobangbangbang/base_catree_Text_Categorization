It us 42.75" tall.

It is 3 1/2 feet tall.
By Paula Whigham on December 14, 2014
About 41 inches. It is, however, not very sturdy so would probably not be good for adult cats weighing more than 9 or 10 pounds.

Question:how tall?
Answer:About 3-1/2 feet. I bought 2 and they are used in my home & my daughter's. The cats enjoy them but they tend to be too heavy & need to be weighted down

Question:Has anyone else had problems with this thing falling over? I've had to take the top tier off because it's so off balance my medium size cat has tipp
Answer:Mine has not fallen over but it is very wobbly... same with some of the other reviews. One person said the made a bigger base. Not terribly dissapointed for the price as my cat is lazy.... but rambunctious cats might give it a run.
By Amazon Customer on June 17, 2017
Yes my cat too... do not buy this.
By Sadia Ahmed on June 17, 2017
Yes it does seem off balanced!
By Amazon Customer on June 20, 2017
Once I put a small brick down on the base, it hasn't tipped over since.
By The Wicked Witch of the West on June 17, 2017

By Amazon Customer on June 22, 2017
Yes, it does tip over, I use 3 small, cement pavers, to hold it still.

Question:How do you put this together? There are not instructions, and I'm thinking of just returning this. It is very frustrating.
Answer:Each piece has either a screw sticking out or a hole. You just screw them together by lining up the holes & turning the piece until its tight.
By jenmc on December 26, 2016
My husband put it together by himself, no hassles

Question:Do you have to attach the middle shelf? I want to put it behind a chair so the cat could use the chair to get to the top ledge.
Answer:The legs screw into each other, the platforms just have a hole for the long screws to go through so you may omit the platforms if you want.

Question:Is the box part made of wood
Answer:I think it's made of compressed wood kind of like what they use for ikea furniture. The construction isn't too bad for the price it's just that the base is too small and the whole thing tips over pretty easily. My cat was afraid to climb up it because it would wobble and the one time she did it tipped over and fell. May work for you if you attach it to a wall somehow. see less
By Abhishek Goel on September 3, 2015
Yes but its top heavy my cats only go in the box they won't go on the ledges the shelves are not stable enough they don't feel comfortable
By Rita Obino on September 3, 2015
Yes, it is made of wood. It is top heavy, so I have placed it in a corner that braces it so it wont tip over. My cat loves her cat trees and uses all of them equally.

Carpet covered wood
By Surviver on September 15, 2015
Yes but it's covered in this soft material. The only problem with this is when my cat sits on the lower level the whole thing tilts and it's not sturdy
By Marissa Lopez on September 3, 2015

Question:is the second landing big enough for food and water bowl? my dog gets into the cat food bowl.
Answer:Maybe if you have a really small cat. My cat is only 6 months old and when he lays down on either landing he takes them both up.
By Amazon Customer on January 16, 2017
No not enough room and with movement from jumping on to it.....it would tip over the food/water.
By sue ann ziegler on January 16, 2017
Probably enough room for the 2 bowls but not enough room for the cat also.
By Susan on January 16, 2017
No it's not sturdy enough for food and water bowls
By peaches on January 16, 2017
