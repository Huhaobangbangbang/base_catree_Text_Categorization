Question:Is this really light grey? It look ivory
Answer:The one I received is ivory. I was confused as well because in some photos online it did look grey. It is a very nice, neutral color that goes well with almost anything. It is a very well built cat condo. My kitten loves it and I am very impressed with the quality of the product.

I put it in the uppermost lounging area. You can probably put it anywhere you’d like to put it.
