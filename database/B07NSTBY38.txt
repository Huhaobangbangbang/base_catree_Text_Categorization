Question:Is the cubby house part solid or is it the flimsy material with the 4 poles holding it up on the inside?
Answer:It’s not flimsy at all. The cubby is material for the sides and a solid bottom which is nice because my fat cat (22 pounds) can fit in it because it as give. I’m very happy with it.
By L Long on April 26, 2020
Quite sturdy. The fabric covers a wooden base. My cat is in the 12 to 15 lb range and it hold him quite well.
By Ellen in FL on April 26, 2020
It’s pretty sturdy even with the 4 poles holding it together. My cat’s like the scratching posts best.
By renacat3 on April 26, 2020
This is very solid. My cat is about 15 lbs. This does not budge or sag at the bottom. Also I have had this for over a year and it has held up almost perfect. The only thing that didn’t is the rope he claws on. I would rather replace that than a couch.
By Tanya Robinson on April 26, 2020
It’s solid and big enough for a big cat.
By Mary Jo Leonard on April 26, 2020
It is solid. Our cat doesn't use it because he hates anything over his head but I have put firm pressure on it.

Question:can the bedding be machine washed?
Answer:No it isn’t removable but it cleans well w a damp cloth. The fabric is quality so wiping leaves it looking new.

Question:How tall is it
Answer:It is 22” tall. If you look at the padding at the top that does add another inch to it. So far my padding has not lost its fluff.
By Tanya Robinson on September 10, 2019
Question:Do you have a bigger size than this? My cat is big. 18lbs and ling. He like to stretxh when sleeping.
Answer:My cat weighs 20-25 lbs. It is large enough for him but he doesn't like it for some reason. He has also destroyed both scratch posts. So this might not be right for you if your cat is rough with his stuff.
By ReenaE on September 29, 2021
My cat is 16# and he also likes to stretch. He fell off once because the sides are just rolled material.
I would not suggest getting this unless they do have a bigger size.
By Linda on September 28, 2021
I don't know if they have a bigger size, but this is bigger than the ones in other cat trees. Our cat is 12# an stretches out in it but she does take up the whole bed when she stretches out. The one in her cat tree is much smaller and she doesn't use it anymore.
By Kindle Customer on September 28, 2021
You need a bigger one. I gave mine away because my cat outgrew it.
By Charline M. Davenport on September 28, 2021
I would say the top platform should be plenty big enough. I was disappointed that the edging wasn’t more of a barrier, so to speak - would prevent my guy from rolling off ( as happens occasional)

Question:Is the drop down pouch removable?
Answer:No, it is not a pouch. It is a solid part of the tree.
By Mbp on March 18, 2021
No. It’s not removable. I had to put a blanket over it.
By KK on March 18, 2021
If you are talking about the house, then no as the third leg attaches to the base of the house to keep it stable. It is shorter than the two scratching posts so if the house is not attached the whole unit will be out of balance and easily tipped.
By ReenaE on March 18, 2021
No. Cats love it.
By Charline M. Davenport on March 18, 2021
Just take it off same way u attached it.
By carole on March 18, 2021
I don't think so, there are supports that are screwed in to make it stable
By E G on March 18, 2021
Sure

I have two cats and only one cat will fit inside
By linda on October 28, 2019
For two cats it would be tight. If they were in the range of 7 or 8 pounds and got along well, otherwise I would say no.
By Rex A. Catt on October 28, 2019
Only if the cats are small.
By Wilburn on October 27, 2019
Yes, if they are the average cat size.
By Jan Michele on October 27, 2019
No it’s pretty small.
By Kathleen E McCollum on October 27, 2019
Yes

Answer:Don’t know the weight limit but it’s very sturdy.
By Shopper on June 12, 2020
The cats I bought this for are about 13 lbs each. They fit fine.
By Mary Jo Leonard on June 12, 2020
I have a ten lb kitty that fits fine, probably could handle more. It is very sturdy & well made.
By Catwoman on June 12, 2020
Haven't weighed it but just guessing maybe 10-15 pounds. Not too heavy but not too light.
By Jan Michele on June 11, 2020
One kitten is 6 lbs up to an adult that is 18 lbs and very sturdy.
By Amazon Customer on June 12, 2020
