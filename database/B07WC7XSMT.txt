Question:What is the weight limit? Our cat is 20 lbs ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Answer:I am not sure but it‚Äôs quite sturdy and it‚Äôs by a window and my 10 year old is leaning on it constantly w her body weight. I‚Äôve seen A lot of cat tree condos, this one looks like a piece of furniture in the room in the light grey,, and the material is soft and not carpet looking. Our cat LOVES this! Highly recommend.

20 lbs should be fine. I have 2 cats at a time on this an no problem. Each weighs about 12 lbs

This will be fine for heavy cats, just not the side piece.

I don't hink it would be ok but I am telling you right now not to buy this product. It took over 4 hours and ALOT of cussing to put together.

Question:is there a hole from the bottom cubby to get into the top cubby or are the separate/blocked off?
Answer:There is no hole but the sides of the upper cubby are not attached to the base of that cubby so my kitties can go between the cubbies. They love to play and nap in their condo.

Question:I have very limited space where i want to put this. Can someone let me know how wide this is at the widest point? (Not including the hammock)
Answer:24 inches is the widest it measures....the little round hammock can be turned forward or to the side to give you more room, too - or completely left off of the unit. My kitten has loved it. It is not very tall, so it JUST makes it so my cat can see out of our windows. I was pleased with my purchase.
By D. Crossett on February 15, 2021
It‚Äôs about 16‚Äù wide, 24‚Äù long and about 32‚Äù high. And our cat loves it!!
By B. on February 14, 2021
I put mine in the corner of the room

The top cushion isn't removable. The material around the cubes does come off in one piece.
By Jennie R. Knutson on September 24, 2019
No, it is connected.

Question:Can this be assembled without the hammock piece?
Answer:You have to assemble the cat tree condo when it comes so you can leave the hammock piece off. It is simple to put together.
My son's large cat, Leo, enjoys the cat tree condo very much. He is on it every day.
By Amazon Customer on January 10, 2021
Yes can be assembled without hammock. Works just fine.
By Stephanie Gibbons on January 11, 2021
Yes. The hammock slides on so you wouldn‚Äôt have to use it.
By Pam Hacker on January 12, 2021
I think so but it may cause the top bed to be a little off.
