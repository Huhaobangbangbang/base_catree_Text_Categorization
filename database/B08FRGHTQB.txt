Question:Would it work well for a 16lb and a 14lb cat?
Answer:It’s pretty stave. My 10&12lb cats can both vibe in the same main areas of the structure without any uneasy feelings. My brothers Rottweiler tried to climb on it and it tried to fall over, but that’s a 130lb crazy dog trying to climb an object not bolted to a wall or floor. I’d trust it.

The weight of your cats should not be a problem. My larger cat just doesn’t like going high on the tree. The walkway around openings are not wide and my smaller cat that weighs less goes to 2nd to the top shelf with ease. Cat tree is sturdy.

Some of the shelves a a little small for the larger cats but my 17 pound cat loves it. I frequently sleeps on one of the upper shelves or in one of the cubbies. He doesn’t even cause this one to rock when he jumps on and off of it.

If they use it like our older cat for scratching and napping then yes. If they use it like our younger 2 for a jungle gym that they race at and hang from then you might notice some loosening on the sleeping perches. Hope that helps. Happy holidays!!

Question:Could this be made to sit in a corner against both walls? I'm unsure if the top platforms or side basket would prevent this.
Answer:I have mine set up in the corner without any issues. I adjusted the basket slightly so it wasn't rubbing against the wall but didn't need to move it much. The top platforms fit perfectly.
By Aubrey on February 22, 2021
