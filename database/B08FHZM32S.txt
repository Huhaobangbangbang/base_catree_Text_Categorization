About this item
üêæ1. Unique design: The interior of the cat tree/condo is very suitable for cats to nap, and can sleep on top of the hammock, and there are removable and washable cushions at the bottom of the apartment. When the cat jumps on the hammock, the base will remain firm. It also has a natural sisal scratching surface and a hanging pom pom ball that can attract cats‚Äô attention and is for cats to play. The cat‚Äôs sharp claws will not scratch the furniture.

üêæ3. Foldable design: The folding and storage cat tower has a unique foldable design, which is an ideal choice for small spaces. It can be stored easily and quickly without taking up space. No assembly required at all: just unfold and start enjoying. The tower provides you and your cat with the best of both worlds and is ideal for those who want to save space in a cat tower.
üêæ4. Good sense of use: During use, it will provide cats with unlimited opportunities to play, explore, scratch or relax.
