Question:Will this fit a 10 pound cat? or was this intended for a kitten?
Answer:It will fit a larger cat, however the arms that come out broke off rather easily. My cat enjoyed it while he had it though.

That is a tough one... I think the bed is big enough for your cat. However if you cat has claws I would recommend something larger that would allow her/him to stretch and scratch. The rope and such are perfect height for kitten to scratch or for low scratching. I bought this for my kitten which she barely uses,she still prefers an upholstered chair :(. But my adult loves the taller one. see less

My 2 15 lb. babies love to curl up in the bed. They also love the scratching posts and use them not the furniture.
