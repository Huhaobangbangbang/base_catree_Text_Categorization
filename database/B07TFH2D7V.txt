Question:I usually place my cat tree in front of window. Is this sturdy enough if not bolted to the wall??
Answer:Depends on how heavy/big your cat is. Mine is jammed up against the wall under the window. Top platform not big enough for my cat to lie on. My cats use it as a ladder.

Question:I don’t understand step 16. Any idea what to do with that white strap at the end?
Answer:Greetings from hey bro.
You can choose to use or not to use the anti roll rewind belt, but for the sake of safety, we recommend using it.

You can follow these steps:
1. First, prepare tools, such as electric drill, etc.
2. Select an alloy drill with the same diameter as the expansion ring (pipe) of the expansion screw, install it on the electric drill, and then drill the wall. The depth of the hole should be the same as the length of the bolt, and then lower the expansion screw kit and the white anti tipping strap on the cat climbing frame into the hole. see less

To screw to wall to prevent tip overs

I believe it’s to connect it to the wall so it doesn’t tip over

Question:My cat is about 13 pounds. Will this tower be okay for him?
Answer:I think so, if your cat likes climbing or just exploring cubbies. My cat is that size and she’s gotten crazy with it. There’s a strap that you can put into a wall to keep it from toppling. I haven’t done that. So far, so good.
