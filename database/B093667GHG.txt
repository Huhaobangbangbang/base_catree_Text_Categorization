Question:How tall is this, You say it‚Äôs 37 an eighth and then you say it‚Äôs 47.5 which is it?
Answer:I would say closer to 37 inches. I don‚Äôt have it with me but it‚Äôs not that tall
By KM on October 21, 2021
It's 47.5.

Be careful if you have kittens. They like to hold on to those soft sides to get on the perch and the sides will flop, and kitten will fall.

Question:Can I purchase replacement pieces? My older cat is too big for the perches and I‚Äôd like to replace one with a wider perch.
Answer:I couldn't find replacements. I have a larger cat also. I managed to find another cat tree that was for larger cats and I still have that one. This one was for my younger two.
