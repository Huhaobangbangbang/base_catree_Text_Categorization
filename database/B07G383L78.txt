Question:Can someone give the deminsions of the upper platform? TY
Answer:The inside dimension of the upper platform is 12” x 12”. The outside dimension is approximately 13.5” x 13.5”. We have three cats (2 full grown and a kitten). All three of them love this level, and it is plenty big enough for one cat (although two of them will squeeze together at some times).

Question:Are posts wood or cardboard?
Answer:I believe the posts are very sturdy cardboard with wood ends. They are wrapped with heavy twine and so far seem very durable for our active kitty.

I got the beige step ladder version. The posts are hard plastic, the flat pieces are some kind of pressed and glued wood. The hardware to attach everything together are metal.
