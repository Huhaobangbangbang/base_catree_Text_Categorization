Question:My cat is 10 or around 10 lbs. Would this work for her?
Answer:I have a 10.5 LB cat and only the very top flat area sorta works for him, but I had to prop it against a wall. This is really better for small cats.

Yes, it is easily big enough for your cat. The pouch where they can sleep will bend over time though and the covering isn't very thick so we ended up wrapping extra fabric around the pouch and top where the edging easily slips off. You should be aware as well that the third leg on the bottom doesn't touch the floor we ended up attaching a thin block of wood under it to stabilize it. Returning it after I'd put it together was too much of a hassle and despite those challenges our cats love it. see less

I think the hammock would be too small. My cat barely fit in the house. The hammock and top shelf were too small.

Probably not, it’s not very stable

Question:Do you have to attach the basket? Or can you assemble it without the hanging basket?
Answer:You can assemble it without attaching the basket. As an aside the cats especially love the basket and spend hours laying in it. In addition, we recommend you set up the Cat Tree INDOORS. We set it up outdoors and it only lasted 3-weeks. We needed to replace all the "verticals" with real wood.

As I was assembling the cat condo I thought about the same thing so here's what I figured yes it's necessary to attach the bed to whole thing otherwise it doesn't assemble well without it. I hope this helps you.
By Maureen 46 on March 28, 2022
no you don't have to attach the basket
By Linda Myers on March 28, 2022
I would not recommend buying this cat tower. The base is so small, it topples over very easily. You would have to attach the tower to the wall to make it safe for your cats.
By Juls03 on March 28, 2022
My daughter assembled ours, but I do not think the basket needs to be attached.
By Janell on March 28, 2022
To answer your question yes you can remove the basket it’s optional I have it on mine but my cat doesn’t use it at all As he is to large.
