Question:I know the basket is small & meant for kittens, but will the top fit a grown, 12 lb. cat? (i like the 36" height because that is my window height.)
Answer:My cat is 8lbs and he still has room. I think you'll be ok. I use the basket for all his toys when I pick them up to vacuum, all the while telling him he should pick up his own toys. LOL

Yes! I bought it for my grand kitty and she is a full grown female and sleeps in the top and in the little hut at the bottom. My son says she lives on it 24/7.

It should! The cat we bought it for is a three year old and pretty chunky, she loves laying right on top.

Yes. I’ve got a big kitty and she sleeps on it. Her legs hang over, but her body fits. She’s about 17lbs.
