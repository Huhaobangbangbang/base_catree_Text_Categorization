Question:Can anyone recommend where I can find a replacement for the sisal pole? Or what the model number of the replacement part is?

Question:My cat is 15 lbs, would she fit in this?
Answer:One of my boys is also a hefty 15 lbs. He’s able to fit through the cave door, the middle section, and the top without any problems. The cube is actually pretty roomy. It’s also nice looking, like furniture.

I have a chubby cat, too. Make sure assemble it so the white square ends up with low side on the bottom. She fits! This thing looks nice.
By George Doering on November 28, 2017
I think she will fit. The condo is so adorable but my cats will have nothing to do with it. Good luck!
By R.J. on November 29, 2017
Probably not, mine is 11 lb and he doesnt fit.
