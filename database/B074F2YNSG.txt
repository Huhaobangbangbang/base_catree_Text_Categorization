Question:Where is the scratching post on this?

Question:Why is the top sleeper post not in the mddle?
Answer:The post is under the top bed. You wouldn't want it in the middle. My cats love this cat tree! They both fit in the beds together!

I'd guess to leave the space for the lower sleeper area and/or to make it easier for cats to get to the top. Looks fine to me.

My cat sleeps everyday on the top of this cat tree. He loves it. It is very sturdy and nicely carpeted. Not cheap and flimsy like other cat trees and is just the right size for me to stand next to and brush him.
