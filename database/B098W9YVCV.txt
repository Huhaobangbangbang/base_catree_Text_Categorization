Question:What are the dimensions for placement of the hardware?
Answer:Hi jamie,
The screws we provide right now is only for solid wall like concrete. These screws are M5*80mm.
If you want to install this cat house on drywall, you could try drill 2 extra holes in the middle of the back board of the cat house.
In this way it can install on the stub of the drywall to ensure its stability. And the other hole could use anchors to fix.
