Question:Will this work for larger cats, like 14 lbs?
Answer:Despite having outgrown the seats from this tree at least 6 months ago, our 16 month old (15.5lbs) still chooses to sleep in the 12 inch round ‚Äîdespite having many more size appropriate options. We are needing to buy this tree again (for parts‚Äîas we combined it with new parts and other trees to create custom FrankenTree you see in the video. It‚Äôs definitely his favorite‚Äîand his 12 lb uncle also curls up in it any chance he gets. Your 14 lb cat would probably be happy with it ‚Äî even if a legs sticks out while snoozing lol see less

I first thought it wasn't going to be big enough I have three cats and one is probably 15 lbs she sleeps on the top part and fits with no problem . I like that it's not huge and too heavy

Question:Can the balls with the bells be removed and replaced with quieter balls? This will be near our bedroom. Plus do you recommend this product?
Answer:No the balls with the bells can no be removed they are built into the disc they are in. I would recommend this for cats that aren't very rambunctious. My older cat had this for years and no issues, but when I got my 1 yr old cat she was rough with it and the tallest post wound up breaking.
By Annie on October 13, 2021
I would say no. I have two large Maine Coons who are able to pull a ball out of every other toy. I've had this for months and they can't get it out. If the cats are enamored with the ball, it is fairly noisy. I would also say the top tier is rather small -- perfect for a kitten or smaller cat, but not a full grown‚Ä¶ see more
By Nancy B. Arnold on October 13, 2021
The balls cannot be removed.
However this is Matcha‚Äôs haven, where she takes her best naps.
When there is another favorite play, the balls become a thing of yesterday. I recommend coils I also found on Amazon. Soft plush toys are awesome for night time nocturnalsüíó
By M on October 13, 2021
No you can‚Äôt remove the balls and yes they are very loud! My cats loved it but it didn‚Äôt last to long before it broke down and I had to trash it.
By casey on October 13, 2021
The balls are just bigger than the hole so they don‚Äôt fall out, but the plastic can be easily squeezed to make them fit thru the hole. My cat loves the scratching post and the top tier bed!
By Amazon Customer on October 13, 2021
Yes, I believe so. They aren‚Äôt loud though. We also stuff little fuzzy mice and pompoms in there as well. Our cat loves it!
By Lora Larocca on October 13, 2021
Yes and yes .. it‚Äôs smaller than I was expecting though

Question:The posts are not particle board, but rather, are cardboard and were quickly destroyed. Does the company replace the tubes?
Answer:If your cats scratch a lot on the posts, it might last 4-6 months.

Question:I have a 17 pound blue Siamese. I‚Äôm not sure if he would fit in on the perches? Help!
Answer:No I think it would be too small for him. I have 2cats that are about 12-15 pounds and they don‚Äôt fit. It‚Äôs designed for smaller cats

When I first got the tree for my kitty she was able to curl up in the perches/ tiers. She was 3 years old when I adopted her, but too much easy livin' has caused her to pack on a few pounds and get too big for her favorite napping place and of course she stopped using her tree. I don't know what she weighs now, but I don't think it's anywhere near 17 lbs. I think if I were you I would pass on this model. see less

We have a tuxedo brother who weighs 13 lbs and sister duo, she weighs 9 and they both spend time on it at the same time different perches playing and sleeping all curled up, so I really think this product can stand the weight, it‚Äôs easy to put together and seems very sturdy.
By Cinnamon Girl‚Ä¶ on June 9, 2020
My cat is 11 pounds and she does hang over a tad, but she doesn't seem to mind! I am unsure how 17 pounds would do though
By b.kenny on June 8, 2020
Nope - it is small. Our cat is about 15lbs and can sit but not curl up on the top perch to look out the window.
By T K on June 9, 2020
My cat loves this but the perch might be too small for your cat.
By Mel on June 9, 2020

Question:Where are these cat trees made and shipped from?
Answer:i‚Äôm unsure as to where they are made, but I can tell you they are tiny.... the round piece the cat lays in is less than 12 inches( prob 10-11 inches round).
And it is not great quality- when i 1st got it it was fallen apart within a week or so.
Pressed particle board and my cat who weighs 12 lbs jumped on it and it broke right off see less

Question:Does anyone know the width or dimensions of the bed up top? Thanks!
Answer:It measures 27 inches tall and the beds measure about 12 inches for the top one and the other one about 10 inches! It‚Äôs a great hit for the money. My two cats have really enjoyed it!
By Cinnamon Girl‚Ä¶ on October 12, 2020
Eleven inches across and depth of 3 1/2 inches. This cat tree is NOT stable. The bed on top fell soon after I purchased. Tried to re-enforce but is still unstable.,
By Amazon Customer on October 12, 2020
Not sure what the dimensions are but it will fit a small to medium size cat....fyi this product want last long the post broke within 2 weeks of having it...
By michelle on October 12, 2020
I‚Äôm not sure of the dimensions, but our 17 pound Blue Siamese fits on the top and still has plenty of room and LOVES it. This is the best Cat tower we have ever bought
By s fuller on October 12, 2020

Question:My cat tree arrived without the hardware that should have been included‚Äîcan this be sent to me?
Answer:You screw in the posts with no hardware needed just till it doesn‚Äôt turn anymore and if you have a basic screwdriver you can tighten the bottom part with any needed hardware, they only send a Allen wrench anyway and you really don‚Äôt need it I basically used no hardware to put ours together.
By Cinnamon Girl‚Ä¶ on August 24, 2020
mine had the screws already installed - all I had to do, was spin the top bed & play area onto the post.
