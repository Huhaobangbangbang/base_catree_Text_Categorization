About this item
The commonly used ropes for scratching posts are sisal rope, jute rope and cotton rope. Sisal rope is the most durable among them.
The cat scratching post is suitable for screws with a diameter of 8mm (M8). If your cat tree or scratching post uses this type screws, then you can choose our repalcement poles.
Compared with other repalcement posts, our 3.5mm sisal rope and 3mm cardbord tube are thicker, so it is stronger and more durable.
The two ends of the cat scratching post are the same, so the posts can be exchanged up and down, which is more economical and durable.
Compared with buying rope and winding it yourself, our products not only wrap it more tightly, but also save your time.
Question:When will you have the longer (17.72‚Äù) M10 posts in stock?
Answer:Thanks for your question. We've shipped various sizes of posts to Amazon last month, but we're also unable to predict the exact arrival time of shipments due to COVID-19 and the strike by workers at the Port of Los Angeles.
