19 x 16 approximately. A cat was laying in it so hard to measure. The other platforms are never used. The rope lasts pretty long. I've decided to only buy all carpet.
By Cat Mom on November 25, 2019
It‚Äôs approximately 18‚Äùx15‚Äù. My cat loves this tree- we call it her chair and it‚Äôs next to the living room furniture. I like it because it‚Äôs not the typical carpet covered trees, so it looks nice and incorporates nicely with my furniture.
