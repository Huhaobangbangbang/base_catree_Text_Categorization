Question:Would it fit a big cat
Answer:Yeah. My cat is a big; and I mean BIG; cat and he ❤️ it. He scratches it and sleeps on it all the time. The only downside (my fault mainly ‘cause of where I have it) is that I’m constantly cleaning it of litter. But, like I said be4, that’s my fault.

Yes, I own one. The top base can fit a cat of any size. The lower bases are smaller and really act like stairs for the kitty. Can’t beat the price either.

Question:Would you recommend this for cats with a little extra "love" (larger cats)?
Answer:My cat is huge , bigger boned and slightly overweight. But I live in a limited space condo unit so it is what it is. He didn’t seem to like it the first couple of days and he looked absolutely ridiculous in it, BUT then I put a thin very plush little blanket on top for extra cushioning and now he totally loves it and seems to like cuddling up on top. And even though it’s really short he has also learned to use the scratching posts several times a day! If your cat has a laid back personality and limited options he should adjust. But it’s not soft enough on its own and without a blanket he will feel too squished. see less

The top platform is especially big...I have a part Maine Coon who is rather large and he fits no problem.

Question:Does this really work ?
Answer:Yes, our cat loves the scratching posts! She is too big for the small hammock in between the posts, but lays in the upper hammock and scratches both posts.

Question:What are the measurements for the bed and also for the cradle on the “Platform” style cat tree?

Question:Would you recommend this for cats with a little extra "love" (larger cats)?
Answer:We didn't buy this exact one, however, it is constructed with quality material and easy to assemble. This one looks ideal for older or larger cats. Hope this helps.

my cat loves it! However, because hes a cat he uses it on his own terms!
By Patricia Ramsey on April 1, 2019
Yes! It’s a great size for my cat and he’s on the bigger side. Honestly he has room to roll around on it and really dig his claws in on the levels

Question:Where can I get replacement scratching posts for these? I need the dimensions of the actual posts holding up the platform for the 21.46" platform
Answer:My cat only scratched on one side; and I figured when it was torn to shreds, I'd just switch the sides around. She passed away and never scratched enough to need a switch. You could strip the original posts and wind new string around it?
