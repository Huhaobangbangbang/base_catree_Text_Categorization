Question:Can the ramp be installed on the other side by the other condo opening?
Answer:They all have holes for the bolts in specific locations. With that said my finished product differs from the main photo. My bottom ladder is on the left side

Question:Is there a weight limit ?
Answer:I'm not sure if there's an official weight limit, but I will say that the tree can stand up strong against three cats that collectively weigh roughly 50 pounds. I hope that helps

I don’t know but I have 3 cats and all of the Jump and play on it and it’s been good soo far. It did become wobbly after a few months, some of the bolts had came loose. I put loctite on the bolts and haven’t had an issue since. I also have it placed along a wall to keep them from tipping it over.
