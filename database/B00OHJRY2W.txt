Question:I'm confused. Looks like carpet, but the description indicates sisal also. Can anyone confirm where the sisal is? My cats don't respond to sisal!
Answer:It's carpet all over. We're on our second sofa. First one lasted 10 years. Have had many cats -- they all have enjoyed it

What's sisal?
By Carmen R. on September 3, 2016
If they don't appear interested at first, rub w a bit of catnip. Ours sits just out of the sun when they get over warm by the slider, they recline on the sofa

Question:Does it have carpet on the under side?
Answer:It has carpet and the rope-like material on the top, and where you see the toy hanging underneath, it is also carpeted. My boy loves it!
By Lorrinda Dickinson on August 25, 2016
Yes it has carpet on the underside.
By Rita Reader on August 25, 2016
I believe it did have carpet on the underside. I don't know for sure because I returned them as they fell apart. They didn't last a week! They were not made well & had visable staples sticking out all over. I bought the same thing years ago from someone else & my cats love it but I can't remember where I bought it. Unfortunately I can't recommend this product. see less
By LYNN M. on August 26, 2016
Yes, but be aware that this one is poorly made--the first few weeks of my cat using it, staples came out of it like crazy!
By Carol A. Smith on August 25, 2016
Yes it does! Our cat loves it!

Question:Is the middle floor a half is shelf or is each hole a separate apartment?
Answer:A half shelf that didn't stay up for me. My cat is normally on top, and I haven't seen either go inside. It's a bit smaller than expected. The 12-pound cat goes on top, and the bigger cat doesn't go near it.
By Amazon Customer on September 18, 2017
Half a shelf. My cat loves it. He stands on the bottom of it and hangs out the top shelf. He also loves to sleep on the top of it. I have it next to my bed.
By buyer on September 18, 2017
They are 2 separate compartments.
By teacherat13 on September 18, 2017
Each is separate.
By Annette Marie on September 18, 2017

Question:The top of page says dimensions 30x18x18. The description says 10x6.5x18. Which is it?
Answer:10x6.5x18. Not only have my cats destroyed the carpeting immediately, but now there staples coming out all around where the carpet was. DON'T BUY IT.
By Casey on May 8, 2015
It is 10x 6.5x18..too small for my cat which weighs 13 pounds ...tried spraying catnip on it and he still ignored it!

Question:What are the dimensions? Height & diameter?
Answer:About 2' tall, 12-14" in diameter, perfect for a medium sized cat.
By David Windhorn on April 26, 2015
It's about 2 1/2 feet tall and there are not 2 cubbies as shown. The bottom cubbie is just a platform. Also, it tips over easily if your cat is big :(
By teacherat13 on April 27, 2015
21" high and 45" circumference. This is a heavy grade well built cat condo.
By Anita A. on April 27, 2015

Question:Description states the color is natural, but the picture is green. What color did you receive and does it fall down when large cats jump down from it?
Answer:It is beige. My cats pull it over sometimes when scratching it and also have knocked it over jumping off of it.
By Amazon Customer on June 1, 2019
Question:how is it?Does it work well?
Answer:Our cat adapted to it quickly. The scratching material wears out fairly quickly but replacement easily acquired at most pet stores/amazon. Occasionally naps on it but primarily used it like a ladder to reach higher points around it. Our cat is heavy duty scratcher and we use several of the smaller versions around the house and monthly trip to vets for a nail trim. see less
By wrr on June 26, 2019
Both cats love it. The cardboard scratching board is narrow. The bed is a little small for either of my cats but they curl up and seem to like it very much. I must say it is study and heavy do it stays in place.
By Mommysues on June 26, 2019
Question:How do you go about replacing the sisal fiber after it worn out? I hate to buy a whole new item..when that is the only part worn out. Thanks.
Answer:My cat only scratches on the carpet. Never the sisal, strange:) I don't think you can replace it. Look for something else with more sisal. I have to look for one with carpet and not the smooth silk material
By leslie on December 18, 2015
I don't believe the sisal can be replaced. My cats claw both the sisal and the carpet. About once a year I trim away loose pieces. After 3 or 4 years it looks so bad that I replace it. It's a small price, compared to the living room furniture my cats are not scratching.
