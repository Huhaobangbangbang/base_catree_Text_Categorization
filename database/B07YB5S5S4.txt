About this item
[ Extra Scratch Boards and Sisal Posts ] This cat tree is equipped with an extra scratching board and posts covered with natural sisal. Kittens can grind their claws on it to help them develop a good habit of scratching. Your expensive furniture can also be protected from damage.
[ Large Top Plush Perch ] The big top perch is wrapped in plush. When the cat is bored, he can look at the scenery outside the window, the birds flying by the window or play with the toy ball below. When the kitten is tired, the cozy perch can provide enough space for the kitten to stretch or take a nap.
[ Plush Condo Playhouse ] A cat condo provides enough rest for kittens. Kittens can lie in a concealed warm apartment and they can also play hide-and-seek inside.
[ Quality Materials ] The cat tree consists of 400g skin-friendly plush, carb-certified particle board and natural Sisal-Covered Scratching Posts. It can be a good piece of furniture to go well with your decor.
[ Reliable Stability ] Safety is always the most important. We thicken the bottom plate of the cat tree to ensure its stability. This is the perfect place for your cat to jump around.

Ours did not. We had to referr to the picture on Amazon to put it together. It's not too complicated but makes the build longer.

I'm not really sure if the scratching posts can be replaced. If it's because of the wear and tear I was thinking about re wrapping with that wrap.

Question:Is the base sturdy? My cat is about 18lbs full grown
Answer:Yes, the base is very sturdy and the quality is very good; however, the size may be too small for an 18 pound cat. My cat is about 11 pounds and she loves it and it is a little small for her height.
By Carol E. Ruggiero on April 18, 2020
It is sturdy but small. My cat is about 18 lbs and he barely fits on the bed at the top.
By Hicks Memorials Janet Hicks on April 20, 2020
Question:Can this support a larger cat?
Answer:12lbs maybe the max size of cat it can support. Our cat takes up the whole top when she sleeps on it
