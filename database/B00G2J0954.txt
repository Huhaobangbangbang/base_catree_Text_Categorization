Question:Could a chubby cat fit comfortably on the top level?
Answer:I don‚Äôt think so. My cat is small and she fits comfortably but if she were much larger, she would have trouble staying inside the bed.
By Amazon Customer on December 30, 2017
Probably not. The top level is pretty small. I put my cats food up there so the dog doesn‚Äôt get it. She puts her back paws on the top step and front paws on the top round piece and eats that way.
By Kathy DelBusso on December 30, 2017
No. My small cat- 6 lbs- doesn‚Äôt fit all that well. However, cats like to squeeze into tight areas, so your cat might like it.

Question:Will the condo hold my 19 lb maine coon, especially at the top, without tipping? What's the distance between the second step and the first level?
Answer:It is 15" from second level to top. I got this because my kitty had a back injury we weren't sure she would recover from. It has the in-between steps that are close together and progress slowly. It is sturdy and I don't think it would tip. However, a Maine Coon at a good run across the room right onto the top, I can't guarantee what it might do. They don't tend to have the balance and delicate landing capabilities of other cats :). see less

Yes. My polydactyl weighs 22 pounds and can do it. I'd say the distance is 6-8 inches. It's well designed for a large, senior cat. Please note if you have more than one, their semi-rough playtime can tip one of the smaller pedestals. It can't be knocked down but it can be bent.
By Aimee on February 13, 2017
My kitty only weighs 6.5 lbs so I'm not sure I would feel safe with a cat that size
By Kathleen S. on February 14, 2017
no I don't think so.

Question:How tall is this product (to the bed part of the top pet bed)?
Answer:The bottom of the bed is at 3 feet. My cat is older loves his bed. He is about 15 years and has easy access to the bed compared to his last cat tower that was 4 feet tall.

Question:Is this made with real carpet or faux fur?

My cat üê± is injured from falling off the top by slipping on the fur step. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.

Question:Any specific instructions for washing the cat bed?
Answer:If you are referring to the two little cushions that come out (the top bed and the cubby hole on the bottom)? I washed them both in the washer on hot/warm and dried in the dryer and they came out just fine.
By Charla C. on July 14, 2016
I have not had to wash the cat bed yet. We have had this product for about six months and it has worked wonderfully for our 14 year old girl. There is a removable cat cushion on the top tier and the tunnel. I have added a small cat blanket purchased from Petco that works well as added cushion to the bed. I wash that often and that helps keep the bed clean. If you are referring to the cushions, just throw them in the washer and they should be okay to dry in the dryer. If it is the actual carpet covering under the cushions, I would recommend hand cleaning with a pet safe carpet cleaner. see less

Question:Could a senior cat without front claws get to the top?
Answer:It is not very far at all for a cat to jump up to the middle level without even using the steps or claws. My cat has claws but does not even need to use them. She jumps like I said---from the floor to the big middle level & then a leap from middle level right up into the top bed. All cats can ump well with or without claws so I would say Yes a cat can get there just fine. My cat just adores this cat tree. She has had it a year in March & is in it everyday. see less

Absolutely, the steps are spaced close enough for an older cat to climb up or down at their own pace, with a nice platform halfway.
By Mark Ludwig on April 7, 2016
Our cat is a three and can jump to the top. That being said he does use the four steps to get up to the top once in awhile. It might take getting used to but steps are close and get him right up there when he's feeling lazy. Hope this helps.

Question:Can this be returned at a Petco store?
Answer:Yes

Question:What is the total height? And what are the heights from step to step?
Answer:I don't have the Trulia model pictured here, but the overall height of this one is approximately 40 inches. The height between steps is approximately 8 1/2 inches. I have the Trixie Emil Senior cat tree but my cat doesn't really use the steps.
By Lynn on October 3, 2020
36 inches tall
Approx 9 inches between steps
By Jodi Kivolowitz on October 3, 2020
3 feet from base to top platform/nest; 9 inches between steps. I actually have mine sitting on two cinder blocks to raise it to where the cats can have a better view out of the window from all the steps.
By C. Cutshall on October 4, 2020
Question:photos in reviews don't match the photos of the product (in gray) provided, so which is it?
Answer:Trixie makes more than one senior cat tree. The pic posted is the Tulia and should be off white. I have the Emil which is brown/beige.
By Lynn on September 1, 2020
More taupe than grey as I recall. It was a gift for someone else so not completely certain.
