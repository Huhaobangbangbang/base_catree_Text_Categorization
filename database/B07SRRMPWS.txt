I’m sure if you go to any pet store you can find something that is the same and attach to cat tree

Question:Is the faux fur durable enough to withstand the cats scratching and clawing it?
Answer:Not really sure. My cat LOVES scratching where she's supposed to, not on the fur. Of course it helped that I used a little catnip on the posts. No problems since

I think it would be fine for your cat

It’s a little smaller than we expected. Our cat is only 5 months old but is very big for his age. He fits on the top platform but barely

Question:How do you even put this cat tree together? Instructions aren't clear.
Answer:Hi there! You are right about the instruction is not super clear. And it took me awhile to finish assembling. However, the instruction should tell you what types of screws go with which layer of the tree, if that makes sense :) You just need to look more carefully. I also just followed the picture on Amazon match my work.

Took ALOT of patience to figure out what the instructions were trying to explain. Myself I separated all the pieces and worked part by part, piece by piece.
By Sarah Watson on April 8, 2021
Worst instructions ever. I went by photos.
By Sara on April 7, 2021
A lil awkward but take your time. Start from bottom and work up.
By Beverley Hill on April 7, 2021
My granddaughter put it together.
By Blake Tate on April 8, 2021
Question:No instructions and no picture?? could u make it a little easier by at least sending a picture with it crazy?
Answer:You are spot, no instructions. Difficult to put together, it is together now and the cat loves it.
By Jacko on January 17, 2021
Mine came with instructions.
By Beth Zinn on January 17, 2021
It is easy to assemble if you look at the photo. I have mechanical dyslexia, and it took me less than fifteen minutes. Just lay out the pieces and work from the bottom up.
By Amazon Customer on January 17, 2021
Question:Is this cat tree made in china like most of the cat trees here? has anyone bought this and replaced its posts with us replarmfs posts?
Answer:I believe it is.
It was actually too small for my cat. Instruction for assembly was poor.
