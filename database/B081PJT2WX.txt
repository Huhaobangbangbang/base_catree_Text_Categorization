Question:How to do put the tree house together? My order didn’t come with instructions.
Answer:Try to follow the picture if you can. Everything screws into each other. The beams that are getting screwed to each other will use the long, double-sided screws. The little hammocks have holes for you to put them on the beam before screwing on the second part, so that it's between them like in the picture. With the boxes, the smaller/skinniest beams go on the insides of all of the corners. Those you will screw in with a tool. Be careful of which box you screw onto which side. It matters. You would have only needed the instructions for about 2 minutes. Once you see what you're doing, you'll get it. The longest part is screwing in the tiny beams Lol see less

Hi, please contact our customer service we would send you the instruction by email.

Question:What tools do I need to assemble this?
Answer:All that was needed was an Allen wrench/hex key. I think one was included, but I am not certain. It has been a while since I assembled mine.
By Patrick on November 17, 2020
It came with the tools needed.
By Debra Wisdom on November 17, 2020
You don’t need any additional tools. I think they sent a little wrench to tighten the bolts with but I didn’t need anything else
By Ceeh24 on November 17, 2020
It comes with everything you need. Our cats love it!
By Amazon Customer on November 20, 2020
Just your hands and small hex wrench that comes with the hardware.
I re-arranged the setup to accomodate her large and tall body and levels.
Its incredible and she loves it esp., with catnip on the rope. Best one I ever bought.
By Chocolate King Pin on November 17, 2020

Question:What is the inches available in the first shelf in floor? I want to put a litter box on it and need to know dimensions.
Answer:Not a lot of space between the columns... 15 1/2 " by 10" is all you could fit. If I were you I'd search for "cat liter enclosure" or "cat box furniture" - and find a nice piece of furniture you can then set this on top of that (or a smaller one of these).
By R. A. Maynard Top Contributor: Guitars on March 5, 2021
Mine is in storage at the moment but it is certainly large enough to accommodate a litter box. If you still want measurements, I’m sure I’ll be out at storage unit today and can get them.
By Tiger77 on March 8, 2021
It is 13" high, but the scratching posts may make it difficult. The area within the posts is 15" by 10". It would have to fit within that rectangle of space.
By MJ on March 5, 2021
15 inches wide and 13 inches high.
By Warren A Peterson on March 5, 2021
Not big enough. No headroo.

Question:Do the bowls hold up over time? My cats are 15 pounds…
Answer:I got this in addition so that she can enjoy the Hammock experience, because she was 16 pounds. She's been losing weight on a diet and loves this, esp., for bird watching.

15 pounds each ?
15 pounds is too much for the hammock bowls. They'll bend and break.
By Chocolate King Pin on August 18, 2021
Mine have but my cats are much smaller than 15 pounds.
By Michele E. on August 18, 2021
Yes they do, it is a very nice and sturdy cat yet stand. I’ve had mine for years and it is still holding up great. My cat is 18 lbs. but she is a Maine coon.
By Tiger77 on August 18, 2021
I have bengals and they are huge, they prefer the levels, the highest to be exact. They are a bit skittish and not trusting of the bowls. They definitely cannot fit in the lower level hammock. The levels are really plush, they love it and are on it all the time.
By Kerry on August 18, 2021
Ours are fine - no issues. Had it about a year. 2 adult cats.
