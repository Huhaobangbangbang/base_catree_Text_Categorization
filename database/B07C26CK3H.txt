I would say that it should, unless they are all going ham and jumping all over it all at once. I have two cats and it does wobble a bit if they are hyper and using it for playtime/wrestling, but has never come close to tipping over.

I have two medium-large cats that actively play on it and it holds strong
By Alaura Titus on October 22, 2018
Indeed it will. Though it came with the option of securing it to the wall, you probably won't need to.

Question:How do cats get from the 2nd to the 3rd level if the 3rd level is directly above the 2nd level & the 3rd level sticks out as far as the 2nd??
Answer:We were concerned about this, too, but there is a bit of room and she figured it out. She was tentative at first, but now she ‚Äútotally owns it‚Äù. I recommend securing it with the wall anchor provided. Note: If your cat has trouble with jumping and climbing, you may want to look at other options. Our cat is a healthy 6 year old weighing 10lbs. She had vaccines a week ago and avoided the tree for 36 hours because she was sore, but now she‚Äôs back at it. see less

My cats have no problem going from mid section (w square platform) up to first or second ‚Äúbed‚Äù pedestal typically they jump to first one then up again. If you get it, pay close attention to differences in screws on first level/base set up. (I messed it up had to take it apart and start again at that point)

The levels are stacked just right. And well...cats are cats. Mine jump straight up onto 2nd level sometimes. Cat Tree sits near couch and they have no problems getting to top, even my older cat.

I‚Äôve never really watched, but I find my cats sitting on all levels. I did a test with a string to attract them and one jumped directly to the 3rd level - with ease.

My cat jumps to the third level with no problems at all. There's barely enough room to climb from one platform to the other with little obstruction as well.
By Stephen M on January 3, 2019
They don‚Äôt really go from the second to third. They jump up to the third level if they want, or to the second.

Question:What are the dimensions of the top perches?
Answer:14‚Äù x 14‚Äù x 1‚Äù for the perches themselves, but the beds built onto them are quite fluffy and add about 2‚Äù to each dimension
By Kailyn Pope on November 6, 2018
The dimensions are 13.8" x 13.8".

Question:Can I buy replacement scratching posts ?
Answer:I don't know but I need replacement parts too. The lower cat platform for them to lay on snapped. It should have lasted more than 1 1/2 years
By Barbara Driver on April 26, 2021
Question:Can the basket be put anywhere or does it have to go in that specific spot?
Answer:The basket part can be moved to another post but it is held in between 2 smaller post so just replace it where you want it on inital set up.

You could use your imagination with this kit a little by swapping some leg positions. I'm playing with it a bit to keep things fun for my two cats.
By Greg Howard on July 29, 2018
It could go to the back pole or the top pole if you switched out the supports. It also moves to get out of the way!

Question:How much weight can the baskets hold? Can a 16lb kitty sit in it without worry?
Answer:I think weight wise it would be fine based on how it‚Äôs made, I have 3 cats ranging in weight from 10lbs all the way to 20lbs. I honestly don‚Äôt think a 16lb cat would fit in it...it seems to be made well but small. My cats don‚Äôt ever use it, but love the rest of tree.
By Stephanie on December 18, 2018
Our big cats seem to use it without worry! They are 15 pounds.
