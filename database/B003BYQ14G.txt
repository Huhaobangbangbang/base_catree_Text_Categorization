Question:are there different ways to build it because the customer images seem to show different cat trees?
Answer:The tree came with pre-drilled holes for the various parts and some with rivet type metal in them. I supppose you could put it together differently, but you would have some exposed metal and holes.

there are many different cat trees but its technically possible to put it together differently than shown..though u might have a few parts left over lol...overall it took me 45 minutes (would have been faster without the cats trying to help)

No, there are a bunch of different cat trees available for purchase.

No, the reviews are very confusing. I noticed while going through the reviews that different models were included in the reviews. So, you have to look and see if they specify the model in the review. There is only one way to build each one and they are all different.

I did not build it because the tree came twice without a support bar that was necessary, but left out. The actual instructions show only one way to build it, however. It looks like it would be really neat if all the parts would come with it. My cats were very interested when we laid it out.

Hi, You can only build it one way. There are different models. So make sure you select the one you want and put it in your cart.

Question:How deep is the cat cubby as I like to call it?
Answer:Our cubby has about a 22 inch diagonal and about 1.25 square feet , so either of my two cats can curl up and sleep. Just not at the same time.

The cubby (house) dimensions are 15" L x 12" W x 9"H. Thank you.

It's not very deep-a full-size cat will fill the space. The main attraction are the two platforms-my cat loves to lounge on those- he only got in the "house" once. That was a really good purchase for us- I highly recommend it.

It's 12" x 13" and my cat is big. He cuddles in side with his tail hanging out. He gets on the top shelf and try's to swat me going by.

I see the other answers gave the exact measurements. I can tell you my 3 cats love it. I have a 9lb cat that loves to scratch it and climb and hang out on the top perch. I have 2 juvenile cats probably half her size and they both fit in the cube and wrestle around in there even. It shakes but doesnt seem to bother any of them. Much better price than you'd fine in the pet stores and my cats use it daily so I'm glad I got it. Hope this helps. see less

Question:How do I attatch the little fuzzy ball on a string to the cat tree?
Answer:I didn't their, was no possible way to attach the ball to the cat tree
By Shevron on November 13, 2015
The ball was attached to rthe first perch with a ruberized string. Sory it took me so lonng to answer. Hope this helped.
By Wink of PM on November 14, 2015
Before I put it together, I used a hammer to attach it to the top floor. Unfortunately, my cats have not used this level often, so it is still in its pristine condition.
By Sylvia W. Rivers on November 12, 2015
There are little loops on the underside of the shelf which you tie the balls to.
By Chris on November 12, 2015
There is a very small piece of cloth or elastic on the underside of the top platform near the corner. I put the black elastic cord of the ball thru it and tied a not :)
By Maria Courteau on November 12, 2015
I just ran the middle of the black elastic cord through the staple and brought the 2 balls back through that loop.
