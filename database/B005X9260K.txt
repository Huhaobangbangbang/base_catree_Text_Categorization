Question:weight restictions? My cat is 15 pounds.
Answer:I have two cats - total weight 16 pounds. It is fortunate that the cat tree is against a wall as they tend to push off it when they get rambunctious. It would surely topple over if not for that. I have had to retighten the screws as they have come loose so keep that key handy. Otherwise plenty sturdy for holding weight (I just sat on it to be sure!). Just wish it had a broader base for when they jump off. see less

Our cat is 12 pounds and it is no problem for her. Very durable.

Our very active cat is just under 15 pounds. He doesn't use it as much as I hoped he would. I have never seen him climb into the cave at the bottom. He does bat the ball round and we added one from his old smaller play station. I have noticed the Trixie casta cat tree wobble a bit. It is in my dining room and I am sorry that I bought it. My cat likes super balls, fake mice, and simple toys like string and tissue paper! see less

I don't know what the manufacturer's guidelines are, but I can stand on it (100lbs+) without it showing any signs of stress. If it's not against a wall and your cat has a running start it might get knocked over, but it definitely won't break from him sitting on it.

We have two cats that get on it... should be a problem...
By satterje on February 17, 2014
It totally won't break, but your cat might not feel super secure. My guy is probably only 9.5 lbs, and there's no shaking at all when he sits on it or jumps around, but I can tell the top level makes him a bit nervous...even when he does go up there, it seems like it feels wobbly to him.
