Question:Is it big enough for a20lb cat?
Answer:No. My cat is 20 lbs and it's two small for him. You would need to secure it to a heavy base because it's too light weight where my cat does not climb it because it tips over. He uses it as a scratching post and place to eat but not to climb on and sleep.

Not sure how big that is but I would probably say no. It is pretty small and the compartment area is small as well. I have 6 month old kittens and they are almost getting too big for it.

I would say yes but I wouldn’t recommend it. It’s very small! Also a pain to put together. This is my 8 month old kitten on it
