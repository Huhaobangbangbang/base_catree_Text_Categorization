Scratching post is made with normal rope on poles. Since it is an outside cat tree the boards have no soft material, just plain wood. Note: The
scratching post are round card board material, the rain may cause the top
pole to break off easily. I had to use pvc 21/2 to remake the bad card board post.

Question:How much weight and abuse will the Hammock the? I have several large cat 15-22lbs and they are not graceful!
Answer:We have 2 cats maybe 15 pounds each and it has held up so far. It's pretty sturdy since the hammock holder is wood. The actual hammock is a removable fleecy material sewed together at the ends to make loops, so it slides onto the holder. It's not a very big hammock, but my cats still like it.

I own 2 of these cat condos. The 9 lb female and 12 lb male gets up there often. The hammock has bent slightly on one with the male cat, but the rest of it is solid. It is one of the better built cat condos I have found. That is why I bought two of them.
By MM on August 14, 2016
The hammock is pretty sturdy and will hold cats up to 12 lbs. My bigger ones have never used it!
By Eveline L. on August 18, 2016
It will take some good abuse. The hammock is "springy", so it flexes and that allows it to hold up to the abuse of jumping on and off. What I would do though is two things: screw a wider, heavy baseboard to it, you can get it for a few bucks at Home Depot or some place similar, but screwing the tree to the heavy and overall wider baseboard will increase the stability by a lot. The second thing I would do it just glue some cheap carpet to the top platform under the hammock, my cats love to run and just and they just skidded across the platform, so I glued a carpet scrap to it to assist with their grip. see less

It probably wouldnt fit 2 bigger cats at the same time, but it would hold one no problem. You could always put some extra stitches but its pretty good quality.
By Melissa Rodgers on August 14, 2016
We have a 16#er that gets up there from time to time with no problem. That's about all I know.

Question:Is the smell of the pine wood strong?
Answer:I did not notice any smell at all. I really like this cat tree. I have ordered two of them. No smell, that I am aware of.
By Amy Donovan on August 3, 2017
The pine wood has no smell at all. It is very dry and well built with winding ropes to act as a cat scratching post.
By Harry O. on August 3, 2017
No, it has no smell at all, it sits three feet from where I normally sit in my living room. It may have a very slight smell when new, out of the box, but that is about it.
By BL on August 3, 2017
No, I just took a sniff and definitely not. Even when I was assembling it I did not notice a strong smell.
By Matthew Isoda on August 3, 2017
Not at all! My cats love this product!
By Grumpee on August 3, 2017
Absolutely not.
