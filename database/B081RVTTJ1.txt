Question:Can the little box/house be assembled without the white cat-head plastic opening? Like could I assemble this whole thing and leave the house open?
Answer:Yes! The white covering with the cat opening can easily be left out. It just slides into the two wooden spots for decorative purposes.
By Jenna on May 10, 2020
I believe so, yes. The white cat part is just a simple slide in..

Question:Can you replace the sisal rope scratch post when they get worn
Answer:It is relatively easy to replace the sisal rope on a post without replacing an actual post. There are videos on YouTube how to do that. Sisal rope is $6 for 100 yards in Walmart.
By JYK on June 12, 2021
After a long back and forth with the seller they finally admitted that you CANNOT buy replacement posts on their website/amazon. Please be aware of that before purchasing. My posts were destroyed after 6 months and no replacement are available. They said I should buy a completely new tree.
By dz on February 26, 2021
Yes, they can be replaced when there is a necessary.
By Made4Pet SELLER  on May 15, 2020
I saw on another cat product that someone purchased sisal rope from Amazon and hot glued it to the poles.

Question:Can the orientation be reversed so that the top perch is on the left?
Answer:Dear Customer,

The top perch can not be reversed to the right, as there is a hole in the top board (left side) which connected the 2 posts on the right.
By Made4Pet SELLER  on January 12, 2021
I don't see why not! There are holes on both sides of that rectangular piece of wood it connects to... you would just switch the hardware so you could put the perch on the left. The cloth piece is velcro, so that could be switched easily.
By Deena on December 31, 2020
I don‚Äôt think so. But, then, I didn‚Äôt add the last pole and top perch. It would have been way too tall for my little kitty to get up there. It‚Äôs almost too tall even without it.

Question:Does this come with 3 boxes?
Answer:I‚Äôm not sure if you meant delivered in 3 boxes ( no just one) and there is only one box on treeüòΩ
By suzanne Clabo on August 17, 2020
There‚Äôs only 1 ‚Äúbox‚Äù what you see in the picture of the cave with a cat face cutout.
By Monica on August 17, 2020
2 boxes and super easy to assemble! The boxes are heavy because the cat tree is substantial and stable.
By Beverly R. on August 17, 2020
Question:I'm ordering this as a surprise gift - does the box it's shipped in show any hint to the cat tree inside the box?
Answer:Hi there, the cat tree is packaged in a brown carton, there is no picture on the carton mark. Only an Item# to identify which product it is. Only when you open the box, you can find out that it's a modern cat tree.
By Made4Pet SELLER  on April 27, 2021
Yes it does. The box is also quite heavy so be sure your recipient is able to lift it. Once assembled, it‚Äôs easier to move around.
By Nancy M. on April 19, 2021
Yes

Question:If this is outside will rain and water ruin wood?
Answer:This tree is Not for outside.
By Martha on October 8, 2020
I don‚Äôt know from experience, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. There are too many areas on the cat tower that I would never want to get wet in my opinion. I.e. sisal rope and the hammock
By Deena on October 8, 2020
Yes. This does not belong outdoors.
By Mrs.Heather on October 8, 2020
'm pretty sure it would....
By Beverly R. on October 8, 2020
Question:Can I change the top spot to a bed? Is it possible to buy a bed (cushion around) and replace the top pad?
Answer:I have this cat tree. It‚Äôs really nice. I added another hammock that i ordered on Amazon. It doesn‚Äôt match but that‚Äôs okay. As far as a bed on too... The top circle platform is pretty small, maybe 12-15 inches. You could make or possibly buy a different top platform since they just screw onto the sisal post.

Question:what are the measurements of the little house? Need to know if my adult cats will fit.
Answer:It‚Äôs 1foot square. Our female can fit but the male, who is a chunker wouldn‚Äôt fit. FYI we got it to replace a talk carpet tower. It‚Äôs adorable and we had high hopes but the cats won‚Äôt use it. They are typical cats, very quirky,
so your cats may love it.

Question:Without the traditional carpeting on this tree, is it hard for cats to climb?
Answer:My cat hasn‚Äôt had any problems. The poles are covered in sisal which works for her. It‚Äôs a much better looking tree since it doesn‚Äôt have the cheap carpet.
By deborah l. on November 30, 2020
It takes a while for my cat to learn how to climb it. But now he is a master and doesn‚Äôt seems to have any trouble.
By Ducksarecool on November 26, 2020
My cats haven't had any difficulty. They were young, and natural jumpers. My surviving cat is 6 and loves the tower
By Michael Perez on November 26, 2020
On my case, they just jump on it and they have had no trouble
By Aadeabreu on November 26, 2020
Yes. They will slip.
By Mrs.Heather on November 27, 2020
Question:Is the cat pole weatherproof?
Answer:Hi there,
This cat tree is designed to be placed at indoor, so the cat pole is not weatherproof. Sorry for that and hope this information is helpful and if you have any more concerns, pls feel free to contact us.
By Made4Pet SELLER  on June 15, 2020
I don‚Äôt know. But I just have to tell you out of all the cat towers we ever had for our Kitties and there has been many, MANY !! This one is the best. After years of trying to keep those darn carpeted ones clean, I just put my foot down and started looking for an all wood one. Will we got the perfect one.
By Amazon Customer judy gomez on June 15, 2020
It‚Äôs soft material so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend putting it outdoors.
By Jenna on June 15, 2020
Question:What is the height between the tallest platform and 2nd-tallest platform? I'm trying to determine if cat's auto feeder would fit or if its too tall.
Answer:I'm so sorry, but I don't know. I had this sent to my mother for her kitty cat. She's on the West Coast (and she's 83 yrs old) and I'm on the East Coast.
