The box is medium sized, long and slender. You will have to assemble the cat tree yourself. This took me about an hour to do. The directions became a bit confusing when assembling the box part to the tree. Hope this helps.

The dimensions are true from the base to the top. The ladder is just a accessory on the side that slants down. I removed the ladder on mine as my cats prefer to just jump to the top. Hope that helps. I have two very active year old cats and it’s held up really well.

No it isn’t difficult to assemble but really it’s only good for kittens or small cats. I had hoped my cat could lie down on one of the perches and she just fits . She isn’t a big cat and less than a year old. It was too much trouble to return the tree
