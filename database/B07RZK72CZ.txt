Question:Where can I get a copy of the instructions? Mine did not come with any.
Answer:Were in the box. But, look at the picture. The tree is not complex. Just put it together. I really did not use the instructions.
By RB Banjo on December 12, 2020
Perhaps try the manufacturer through info on the posting sight? I'm functionally blind and couldn't see the instructions, even with electronic magnifiers so I spread the parts out on a table. I used the finished picture and sussed out how to do it. I put pieces together before fastening them. I didn't need to undo anything, it does make some sense. The scratching pad was awkward but after a bit I was able to get the bolts to start. Took maybe an hour or so.......FYI, cats will never understand I can't see them no matter how many times I stumble over them. One is black, I can't see black......They like the condo at least........ see less

Question:How tall is the highest part of the tree?
Answer:37 inches to the very top of the tree house. Our cat really enjoys the Tree Condo, he sleeps on top of the tree house all the time.
By Foy Spann on January 12, 2021
The tallest platform reaches 38 inches. It is flat but padded with a small ridge of plush fabric around it. It is were your kitty can curl up and nap or look out a window. Hope this helps.

Not that I know of. If they're broken beyond use, I haven't seen any replacements. But if it's just the fabric and rope that needs replacing, you can buy sisal rope and rewrap them.
By Amanda Jettie on November 3, 2021
No it is built into the post on the bottom.

Question:Would this tip over easily with a 22lb cat?
Answer:Not sure as our cat is much smaller my guess is it would not tip over as it has sturdy base

Question:Can the poles be rewrapped with sisal and hot glue or something over the fabric?
Answer:Dear aKSamsara,
Thanks a lot for your question.
As for the issue you met, we suggest you not to rewrap the poles over the fabric,because the fabric can not be glued tightly by the glue and the sisal will fall off easily.And also, the whole poles will not be balanced with the middle part thinner and the two sides part… see more
By BEWISHOME SELLER  on February 5, 2021
Yes. Just rip off the old stuff and glue and tack on the new.
By RB Banjo on February 5, 2021
I don’t know why not! My two cats enjoy this very much and their claws have not ruined anything yet.

Question:Is the condo a solid piece of cardboard or that pull over thin carpet?
Answer:I’m not sure of the construction specifics, but the carpet is fluffy, and the parts of the cat tree that take weight are large and sturdy. The sides of the “houses” are thin carpet only, but they don’t take any weight. My cats love it.
By Cd on March 31, 2020
Much of the condo is made of wood. And the carpet is thick.
By D. Katz on March 31, 2020
It is a very solid piece that is holding up very well
By Thomas J Hyland on March 31, 2020
The material is fleece like . The bottoms and tops are all fiber board, somewhat sturdy. The sides of the houses are just fleece material, held up with wood post in each corner, soft sided. It’s overall pretty sturdy for cats, kids can not sit on it. My cat likes to sleep at the very top. Hope this helps.
By Juanita Labadie on March 31, 2020
