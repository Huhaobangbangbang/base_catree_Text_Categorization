It’s about 48-50” tall, and can support 2 medium sized cats, or one large cat, although the holes in some of the pieces are kind of small and a fat cat may get stuck trying to go through them

The picture on Amazon shows it is 49.61 inches high. Our cat is 16 lbs and it is still very sturdy so I would guess that any size house cat will be just fine.

The size dimensions are in the description. My cats can look out the window easily. We have 20 LB + cats and they are fine on it:

Question:How much food does the bowl hold?
Answer:It’s pretty big and probably holds around 1-2 cups of dry food. I don’t use it because my cat kept knocking it around and making a mess, so I took it out and now there’s an extra hole for her to climb through.

It’s not a very large bowl. It couldn’t be use as the only food dish. It’s more like a snack bowl!

It holds quite a bit. I would guess at least two cups.
