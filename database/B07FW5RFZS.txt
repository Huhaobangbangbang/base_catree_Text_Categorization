Question:Does it come assembled?
Answer:No you have to assemble it. But that is really easy. Less then twenty minutes for my wife and I. Comes with the necessary tools included. Also east to take apart if needed. Our pampered Tom cat child wanted it in the living room, not the home office which required taking it partly apart and reassembling it in the living room. Now he is happy with it. see less

Question:How big are the platforms on this unit? My cats are pretty big. Thanks.
Answer:If you have big cats I would suggest buying a bigger one. It's great for my small kitty, my medium size (about 12 pounds) can use it but she hangs off the top tier. It's way too small for my big 18 pound Tabby! The cubby hole is just about useless, even for my small kitty. I plan to buy a larger one myself!

Question:On the "duel post" style tree are the poles wrapped scratching posts? They dont appear to be in pic but description says "jute fiber scratching posts"
Answer:The poles are both climbing and scratching posts. My cats claw and hang off the posts all the time. You want posts that are all jute rope. Even the jute will get clawed up but it should take a year, not a few weeks.

The dual post I received is just carpeted posts, not jute as described. Maybe the larger units have jute but my dual post is not and looks the same as the pictures here online.

Question:Would this be tall enough to keep dog out of cat food?
Answer:It would depend on the size of the dog and if the dog can climb. It's not THAT sturdy.

If ou had the food up top and the dog would hit it or run into it just right I'm sure the food would fall off of it.

I have my cat tree in a corner of a room so it has walls on either side of it to support it.

Maybe you could place your cat's food up somewhere else or in a room where you could shut the door and the dog couldn't get to it? see less

Possibly. It comes to about hip level... the platforms don’t seem big enough for bowls though.

Question:On dual post, what is the height of each of the platforms?
Answer:the first platform is about 18 inches off the ground and the next one is another 18 inches up and then the next two are about 15 inches up. Overall just under 6 feet tall.

Question:How tall is this?
Answer:About 6ft 6inches or 198 cm from floor to top of the highest platform. It could be slightly (1-2inches) shorter then that as it was a bit hard to measure properly where I have it located.

I can't tell if this is the information you want, but I ordered the standard tower. It stood about 4' with the towers, maybe more. I took the towers off as she didn't seem to like them. Besides she really wanted to just lay on the surface.
