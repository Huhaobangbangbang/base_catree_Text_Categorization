Question:What assembly is required? Are the holes all pre-drilled?
Answer:The tree comes in 2 parts. All you have to do is screw on the top part. It's a small piece, maybe 2 feet high, and very easy to attach. Only takes a couple of minutes, and it's ready for your cat to use. My boy loves it! He's a large cat and the top bed is large so he has plenty of room to nap.
