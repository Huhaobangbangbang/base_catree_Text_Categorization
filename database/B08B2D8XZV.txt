Question:Is it possible to put a litter box in the bottom shelf?
Answer:Personally, I wouldn't do that. I ended up giving mine away....but not sure if a litter box would even fit through the hole, and it would be difficult to clean it out.

Question:Do you think cutting a hole at the top would ruin the structural integrity?
Answer:No, I don't think that cutting a hole in the top would ruin the structural integrity mainly because the condo is secured by straps that hang on the top and the bottom of a door. The inserts are made of thick corrugated plastic. I don't know if by cutting a hole in the top a cat would still be able to climb on the roof of the condo, but a hole certainly wouldn't render it ineffective as a cat tree. see less

The top has a rigid structure placed in it to keep it upright and hang straight for the topmost level. Your cat may not need a hole to get on the top. One of my cats loves to climb out onto the top. She is near the ceiling, has nowhere to go, but must like the view. She has done it more than once so, I think it is jus… see more

There already is a hole for the cat(s) to get onto the top level, you just can't see it in the photo.
By C.J. on February 10, 2021
I don’t think so since the side have inserts that make them more stable.
By Amazon Customer on February 10, 2021
Probably yes since it secures on the top.

Question:Does it come with brackets?
Answer:There are two brackets each on both the top and the bottom, that hook over and under the door. They were just a tiny fraction too thick to allow my door to close properly, but I managed to rig up the climber successfully on the side of a bookshelf.
By Kiki on February 18, 2019
Yes, it does.

Question:Am I able to hang this on the side of a 44” high playpen by pulling the straps tighter?
Answer:The distance from the top of the hooks that go over the door to the adjustable strap buckle at the bottom is about 75 inches. This won't fit on a 44" tall space. The product description says it's 57" tall but I have no idea what they're measuring to get that number.

No. That is not possible

Question:How does this fold relative to it's position on the door? Do the 2 compartments fold vertically up?
Answer:It appears that the shelves fold up, but I have not tried to fold them. I keep the unit open at all times.

Question:How do cats get to the top cube? I don't see anything for them to climb on
Answer:There’s a hole in the top of the bottom cube and the bottom of the top cube that my cat jumps through. He lovesssss this thing.
By Rose Bagley on June 21, 2020
On the bottom of the top Cube there is a circle cut out for them to climb up in . My two love it, they also climb up and sit on the top cube which is a solid and sinks in a little bit like a Hamic fillet up there.
By DJ on June 21, 2020
They climb from the outside off of the edge.

Question:How wide are the top and bottom hooks? The door I would hang it on is a bit thick, so I worry the hooks will be too narrow.
Answer:They should be wide enough. I ve measured mine. In cm(centimeter) they re a little bit more than 4. In inches this should be like 1.6(from online converter)
By Cliente Amazon on November 12, 2018
It fits a little over a one and a half inch door thickness but not a two inch door thickness.
By caroline h. denison on November 11, 2018
Question:Can the cats take naps on it?
Answer:For sure, if you're cat is less than 10lbs. Might be tight if it's bigger, but mine loved it!
By I. Clark on January 5, 2021
My cat has grown pretty big so he’s grown out of being able to sleep on it.
He still loves it and eats his food there, I have a dog Who wants to eat his food so that’s his dinner spot. Otherwise he does crawl in and out of it and on top of it playing.
