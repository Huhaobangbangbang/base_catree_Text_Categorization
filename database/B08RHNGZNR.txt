Question:Measurements of beds?
Answer:I believe that they are between 15”- 17”. There are different sizes. I have a full grown cat, and he fits perfectly on any of the spaces, especially the round hammock like bed.

Not sure of measurements but this is fairly small. My cat is 9 pounds and barely fits in the basket. Also, this is very wabbley. You need to put it against a wall or attach it to a wall. My cat makes this thing shake even against the wall and she is only 9 pounds.

Question:Need help assembling?
Answer:Not sure how to help, as I don’t know what exactly you need help with! I started with the circle house thing. The carpeted rods go inside. Screw top and bottom of each rod. Attach three small tan rods to the base board. There is a funky shaped board, the weird park goes towards the pole with the circle cat house will be on. Then attach the circle cat house you just built. One short tan rod attaches to the cat house and the only two rods are one long one and one shot one. The long one goes first. Attach it then add the cat Hamic, then the short rod and last add the top board then you are done!! Hope that helps! see less
