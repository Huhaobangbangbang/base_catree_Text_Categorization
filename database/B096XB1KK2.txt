From what I can tell no. It comes with an extension. I would just say buy a metal pole the same width as the one you were given and use that. It won't wobble and you can buy it the exact size you need. My pole keeps falling down all the time.

Question:Can this cat tree be assembled without the perches in the middle? I want my cat to be able to climb straight up.
Answer:This cat tower need to be attached to the ceiling for added safety, all the platforms and perches are balanced on the left and right side of the cat tree. Firstly, it provides a place for rest and jump to a higher platform, Secondly, it's more balance and stable with them. Thirdly, cats/kittens always enjoy staying on either the platform and the cozy bed, Fourthly, there is a hanging ball toy for kitty to paly with. So we strongly advise to have it assembled between the two scratching posts.

If it is like most of the same type trees, you should add the perches but to facilitate it be easier and quicker to climb, and to stabilize it, I have in the past purchased ( at my local home improvement center) a long length of PVC pipe that I put up the middle of the thing. It can provide great stability and help with wobbliness. I guess there is a possibility you could TRY to assemble it with the pipe and NO perches, but as the manufacturer suggests, I would say leaving the perches on is best. see less

Question:What is the maximum weight this will hold? I have big cats.
Answer:Hello, the cat tree tower is for small and medium cat, large cats over 20lbs are not recommended for this cat tree. In addition, as the scratching post connected is high to the ceiling, it's very important to make sure the extension rod is connected to the ceiling before cats climbing on the tower.
