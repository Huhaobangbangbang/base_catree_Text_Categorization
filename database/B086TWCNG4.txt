About this item
[ Cat Kingdom ] This is the cat‚Äôs own kingdom, it can do anything that it wants to do inside. The kitten can take a nap on the top plush platform or look at the scenery outside the window. Plush cat condo and basket create a perfect resting area for your cat.
[ PATENT PENDING DESIGN ] We designed the cat tree into multiple levels. When the kitten is on the top platform, it can enjoy the feeling of being at the top of the world. Lively kittens can explore, play and rest in it. At the same time, kittens can also exercise climbing skills.
[ Sisal Scratching Posts ] The posts are covered with natural sisal. kittens can grind their claws on it to help them develop a good habit of scratching. Your expensive furniture can also be protected from damage.
[ Quality Materials ] The cat tree consists of 400g skin-friendly plush, carb-certified particle board and natural Sisal-Covered Scratching Posts. It can be a good piece of furniture to go well with your decor.
[ Reliable Stability ] Safety is always the most important. We thickened the bottom plate of the cat tree and added an anti-tipping device to ensure its stability. This is the perfect place for your cat to jump.
Question:How difficult is this to clean/vaccum?
Answer:It is actually pretty easy. You need a good vacuum attachment hose to pick up the cat hair, but it comes clean easily and my ‚Äúkids‚Äù love it!
