Probably about 4 feet. It was super hard to put together but seems very sturdy once we finally got it together.

Question:That looks so small for big cat
Answer:It is a little small but I have two good sized cats and they both use it. It actually has helped bring some harmony between the two of them. There's plenty of room for both and the design allows them each to have a cozy spot for themselves.

It is a lot smaller than I thought. My cat is small and it is still too small.

I have a 14 pound tabby and size is fine. However, small base makes it unstable. You would have to stabilize it against something or nail down.

It is for a petite cat. I wouldn’t get it for anything over 6lbs. It fits my 6 month old kitten perfectly.
