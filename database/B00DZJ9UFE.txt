Question:4 CATS - None under 18 pounds - will this product hold up to, say, 3 at a time boxing each other for top floor? It's what I hoped for if it works.
Answer:Let me start by saying I LOVE this cat tree- it's nice to look at, goes together easy. We have several cats under 18 pounds, and as the tree comes right out of the box, ***I*** wouldn't trust it to not tip over. BUT, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and placed a very heavy stone (in this case, a granite block- probably in the 75-100 pound vicinity) on the base, and now I trust the tree completely not to tip over. see less

It's quite sturdy, my 2 cats play on it together and it holds really well. Tbh my cats are both under 9 pounds lol I would put something heavy on the bottom to keep it steady. The good thing is that there are a lot of polls for them to grab and play, not too many platforms in the way of the climbing.

Question:What are the posts made of?
Answer:Sisal wrapped post.. Post are made of heavy plastic.. I own two this style and another larger one from the same company.. I love the solid wood construction.
By Linda B. on September 16, 2015
The posts appear to be made of plastic core, covered with a layer of cardboard-like material, over the top of which sisal rope is tightly wound. The only part of the posts that is visible is the sisal rope.
By Margalit on September 16, 2015
Hi,
They are made of paper tubes with sisal rope.
Thanks.

Per the description Made with original grain, Pinus Sylvestris polished wood

Hum I think it's sisal material.

Question:Is the height 89” from the base all the way to the top of the house? Also, is it too wobbly, or still stand with one 13-14 pound Norwegian forest cat?
Answer:Yes, you are right. The height 89" is from the base to the top of the house. The max holding weight for this model is 80lbs.
So it is sturdy enough for 13-14 pound cats. To make it more stable, you can try to tigten it after months use.
By armarkat SELLER  on February 26, 2018
Yes, the height is from base to top of highest box. It's not wobbly at all. It has handled my 18 lb cat chasing my 14 lb cat up and down it with no issues at all. I've now bought a total of seven different towers by this company because they are so well built.

Question:How strong is the wood scent? Does it dissipate over time?
Answer:There is no strong scent to the wood.
By StateLineTack SELLER  on May 7, 2015
I didn't notice any strong wood smell, or I completely forgot I did. I remember opening the box you could obviously smell the wood as it was all boxed up and without air but once it was out, I seriously do not recall any smell lingering. It's a great tree, my cats love it.
By Ludivine Vallano on May 6, 2015
I don't notice one.

Question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?
Answer:They are right between 1/2 and 2/3 of an inch thick.
By Ashley on July 3, 2015
Hi,
The thickness of the wood boards is 2"
Thanks.
Helen,
By armarkat SELLER  on July 6, 2015
The boards are a little bit thicker than 1/2 an inch. My cats LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cat tree -- and it looks very nice too (much better than the "typical" kind covered in carpet. I highly recommend it!
By DJH on July 4, 2015
1/2" boards as well as the wooden houses... Finished edges.. Very well constructed. I own 4 of these trees.
By Linda B. on July 3, 2015
1.2 inches (3 cm)

Question:can it be used on a large covered front porch?
Answer:Hi,
The dimensions are 48.8 x 14 x 89 inches, please compare it with the porch's dimensions and confirm if the cat tree can be used.
By armarkat SELLER  on July 6, 2017
It is made from plywood and NOT particle board, so YES. My cats love it. I put beds on the two large shelves which are now their favorite sleeping spot. Worth every penny.
By JM in Arizona on July 4, 2017
I don't see why not but I would still be concerned that it would get wet.
By Tiffany Oliveras on July 5, 2017
Sure.
By M Tyler on July 5, 2017
Question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.
Answer:Hi, The base dimension is 24"*19".
Overall size 34"*49", means the longest length and width for assembled cat tree. The dimension of oversize is mostly decided by the edge of the perches. The perche and house stretch out a little, and they make the overall size bigger than the base plate. Hope the explanation is clear.
By armarkat SELLER  on January 25, 2018
Hello...

The base size is 14" x 23". Height is 89".

This is a very high quality unit. None of the previous cat trees we've had compare with the Armarkat. It is well worth the price.

Paul

This unit is made with very high-grade plywood.

The base is 19 x 23. This is a very sturdy and stable tree. My 4 cats love it and so far I’ve been more than happy I got it. I’ve had other trees over the years and none have been this good; it was worth the money. Didn’t take long to put together. My only complaint is, the wooden platforms are too slick and I had to put a type of low level carpet on them so the cats could get traction. I’d give it a 5-star rating. see less
By crabbycat on January 24, 2018
That is correct it is not 49,i dont know exactly.im not there but thats wrong
By mike g. on January 24, 2018
It's approx 19"x 23". Don't let that deter you though. This cat tree is the bomb dot com. Seriously though. My cats love it.
By Valerie Vance on January 25, 2018
It's 19" x 23"

Question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?
Answer:I have my cat tree next to the wall on a flat ️uncarpeted floor.. But it would be very useful to fasten to the wall to prevent it from being pushed or pulled over.. I could see where a child might try and climb on it and it could fall over.
By Linda B. on May 25, 2015
I placed a large block of granite on the base to keep it from tipping. I see others didn't have an issue, but I just didn't trust it enough to not stabilize it in some way. Anchoring it to the wall would be peace of mind, for sure.
By K on May 24, 2015
No need to anchor it's very sturdy. Best tree I have gotten.
By My toys on May 24, 2015
You probably could. Keep in mind that the top cube juts out, I. E. It is not flush with the back of the platform or the back of the other levels.
By Margalit on May 25, 2015
You could if you wanted too. However we didn't see a need to as this tree is very sturdy. It's never tipped over even with my cats racing up and down.

Question:Is there a way to place the bottom box "house" more towards the top?
Answer:Hi,
Sorry, we could not place the bottom box "house" more towards the top, as the stability was considered when designed.

Question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.
Answer:My cats (3 a year old cats) love it and we love it. They climb onit, play on it, sleep in the and on the upper box. Unfortunately the other box we installed (by instruction) on the lower part of the tree. Cats don't use it and that one is bigger box. Two cats can get together in the upper box. One of my cats like to scratch the scratchers. They don't mind being on wood, so we didn't put any mat. You can easily put one if you want. It looks very beautiful and matches our built in cabinets. We are very happy that we purchased this cat tree. I have a nice video of my cats playing there, which I am planning to post in manufacturers website. Hope my answer helped you make a decision. Smiles! see less

Cats are comfortable on bare wood, they love trees after all, beware potential splinters if you remove the carpet from this tower, because it won't be treated wood. Ultimately, the cats will love the height from this tower, it's the best gift anyone can give a cat.
By Mr W Gibbs on August 9, 2017
My cats use the wood more for climbing up to the next platform, but you could attach a bed or fabric of your choice with Velcro to the wood.
By Tiffany Oliveras on August 9, 2017
It seems like the bare wood surfaces take some getting used to, especially if the tree is a bit unstable. Given some time your cats will adjust to it, especially if it can be made stable, say set in a corner and on a hard surface.
I might note that the Aramark at cat trees are very well made of extremely high grade (9-ply) plywood and simple enough to assemble with their instructions. see less
By Kindle Customer on August 9, 2017
They are comfortable when reposing (and they looooove the hammock) but they do slip around on the wood if they jump on at speed, sometimes even leaving scratches as they try to arrest their momentum. I definitely think this would be improved by some carpeting, although I am happy with it generally and they certainly don't avoid it. see less
By Anthony Litton on August 9, 2017
Question:How big is the box it's delivered in?
Answer:I don't remember the exact measurements. It's definitely on the big box side. Not rectangular, but a box. Maybe like a large moving box?
By thinkdammit on June 28, 2016
It's pretty large, if I remember, probably 2 1/2' x 2 1/2' x 2'
By Lillian on June 28, 2016
Extra large, and you have to assemble it.
By Kim on June 28, 2016
As I recall it was near 36" square.
By Gregg B. on June 28, 2016
Question:Does anybody have declawed cats using this tree?
Answer:No. I have 2 of these and 10 cats, all with claws. These are super wobbly and cannot be tightened enough to make them stable. They must be secured to a wall and ceiling or to the wall in 2 places. Stability will be even more important for declawed cats. I definately like the "no carpet" feature of this tree. So much easier to clean. Cats love the hammock feature and the house at the top. see less
By HHHansen on March 26, 2018
NO, who does that to cats these days?
By JM in Arizona on March 25, 2018
Yes front only but i have other towers next to it. Planks are solid wood, but he likes it.
