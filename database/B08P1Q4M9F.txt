COMFY AND ENTERTAINMENT: All floor panels are nicely carpeted, which is soft and luxurious. Constructed with 3 plush top perches with raised edging to curl up on it or enjoy view out of the window; 2 spacious fluffy condos to snap or roles themselves into little balls to hide; Sisal scratching posts to meet their instinct of scratching; cozy hammock and basket to hang off. Totally meet their fun of chasing each other, climbing and jumping on and off.
EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND DECORATION: Equipped with step by step instruction, which is straightforward and the only tool required is an Allen wrench to tighten the screws, which was included in the package. The cat tower is recommended to be placed in the corner or near the window. It is also very stylish and fit well with other furniture in your living room.
OVERALL DIMENSION: 19.8”L x 19.8”W x 66.3”H(50.5 x 50.5 x 168.5cm). Cat stand is perfect for large cats or kitties. Your complete satisfaction is our guarantee, please feel free to contact with us, if you have any problems before or after purchase.
Question:Are the perches large enough for a 16 lb Maine coon cat?
Answer:They are actually pretty small. The little stuffed roll around the edges is very soft, and does nothing to hold them on. That being said, my largest cat is 14 pounds, and he does seem to enjoy sleeping on them, it just doesn't look the most comfortable. I just don't know if a larger breed of cat would really enjoy them enough.

Honestly probably not. We have a 13 lb & 8 lb. They barely fit

No. They advertise 14.17" square. They are actually 12" square. Way too small.

Question:mine was missing screws where can i find more my local stores dont have the ones i need ?
Answer:Depends on which screws is missing ,bit yes you can get it from the hardware one of the box stores , just make sure you get the exact same length and width, if you have an old tree those should fit the new ones, just a tip, when I get the cats a new one i keep some of the screws just to be one the safe side. I hope this helps out. see less

Question:Is this tree good for 1 30lbs cat?
Answer:No, it’s kinda week on my 16 pound kitty and eventually (I think I’ve had it a year) it started to bow on one of the bottom legs

Question:Also, why are so many people missing screws or boxes? that concerns me. I have several saved, but I want good quality & prefer to not be missing parts
Answer:We had no missing screws or parts, very well made and sturdy! Our cat loves it, the only thing is the fabric is showing a few pulled fibers from the kitten using it so much…she plays so hard the hanging balls with bells sometimes come off, but are easily tied back on. Overall, very happy with layout, design of product.

Question:are boxes actual boxes? or just material wrapped around it to look like a box? Saw a review saying it was just material. I want an actual box.
Answer:They are not actual boxes. Instead, in each corner is a 1” in diameter carpeted round post that creates/supports the box shape.
By Kathy G on April 22, 2022
No, they are not actual boxes. They have a fabric covered hardboard to and the rest is fabric wrapped around the sides and posts.

It's material not an actual box
By Lady L on April 22, 2022
The top and bottom of the boxes are solid wood covered in fabric, but the sides are just fabric supported with steel rods in corners.
