Question:How is this installed? How do I know if it will work on my cat tree?
Answer:If you had to assemble your cat tree, this will more than likely work. You will have to figure out just where on your existing cat tree that you'd want to attach this. Simply take your cat tree apart to get to the spot you want to attach the hammock, place it on a screw/join of your existing tree (there is a small hole in the arm part of the hammock) and reassemble your cat tree. Hope this all makes sense! Just know, if you have a larger cat, they might not use it, as it is a small hammock. See my review to get a sense of size. :) see less
