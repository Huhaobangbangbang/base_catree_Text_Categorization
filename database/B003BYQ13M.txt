Question:Is the top platform real stable? I've had a similar condo before and the top on that one was very wobbly and eventually started leaning
Answer:It's actually pretty sturdy. It may look wobbly sometimes if the cat runs and jumps up there but it's never actually leaned over for me. Our cat is about 15-18 pounds, it took her a couple days to warm up to using it but now she jumps all over it. Loves to lie down on the top platform.

The instruction manual advises to re-tighten platforms periodically to keep them steady. My cat is very heavy so platforms seem to wobble at times but they do not lean. We like this product.
By R. Wadman on September 20, 2017
I have no problem with leaning or wobbly platforms - just make sure you tighten up all the posts . Go back over the posts in a couple of days to re-tighten, if necessary.

Yes, the entire condo is very solid and stable. I've been very impressed with it.
By M. Kennedy on September 21, 2017
It is fairly stable, although I have it against the wall so that adds more stability. My cats are not afraid to be on the top platform, and they are usually afraid of everything.
By Amazon Customer on September 21, 2017
So far the top platform is stable and one of my cats sits up there daily. I've had the condo for about 3 months now and once I weighted the base down its been fine.

Question:im worried it be too small for my cat, he is 10, he a bit longer than a usual cat, is 50-60 inches is big enough for an adult? thatslike 4-5 ft right?
Answer:My cat is about 10 pounds male and very active, the tree lasted 1 month and now it's sitting in the garage not being used because the top wobbles and keeps falling off.... and the top started tilting due to his weight so that it kept falling over. We have had to put the top back on over and over but it keeps falling off, its cheap but you get what you pay for. You have to put it up against a wall so it won't fall. Buy something else if you have an active 10 plus pound cat, it's OK for kittens until they grow up. Waste of money. see less

Hi, my cats are pretty big (17lb)and they love this thing! They both play on it and sometimes I am scared it is going to fall over but it didn't happened yet! As well, they are usually very unimpressed with anything I get them but this was the best thing ever for them!
By Iveta Woodruff on January 12, 2016
I have 2 cats, one very petite and one very large and only the smaller cat is able to use this tree. It will teeter very easily with weight being shifted on the towers. The cat that uses this is only about 7 lbs.
By Amazon Customer on January 11, 2016
We have a large male cat and he loves this cat tree! He sleeps on the very top platform all the time. He just curls up as most cats do and seems to be nice and cozy. The height of the cat tree makes him eye level to me when he's laying on the top platform. I'm 5'8". Hope this helps!

Question:Hi everyone! The item title says "beige", but the product description says its green, ?? image looks like sisal posts,but not stated in description
Answer:Hi, this item is all beige like the photo. We liked the price and, after a year, are still very happy with it. KEEP your 'allen' wrench tho (that comes with the package to assemble it) because once in a while everything needs to be tightened. We feed our cat on the platform 2nd from top because we have doggies too. So this has turned out to be one of the best things we've purchased in a long time. Oregon see less
By L. E. Dillon on November 6, 2014
Mine came as beige. The cats like it a lot. :-) Best suited for a corner, as I believe was intended. And yes, sisal posts.
By BananaGeek on November 6, 2014
The cat tree is totally beige, and the posts are all sisal. My two cats love to gaze out the window on this tree. It tends to fall over easy so I just put 2 of my husband's 10 lb. weights on the base. Problem solved! I should have said it is somewhat unstable, especially when large running cats jump on
By Sal on November 6, 2014
It's definitely beige. Not a hint of green to it - maybe a little yellowish, actually.
By Lisa La B on November 6, 2014
Definitely beige with sisal posts. My cats loves it!
By Patricia M Peyton on November 6, 2014
Mine was beige with disposal posts.

Question:How soft is the faux fur? I bought my cat a super, super soft faux fur blanket and she won't touch it!
Answer:There is no faux fur on this cat post. It isore like an indoor-outdoor carpet.
By josette skelnik on February 22, 2015
It's soft, but not too soft - more like a soft, short tufted carpet. My cats love it - sleep and play on it all of the time.
By Karen B on February 22, 2015
it's like carpet soft. My cat loves his.
By C.ha on February 22, 2015
Are you familiar with the insides of Bearpaw slippers, the faux sheepskin material? Just like that. Soft and coarse, if that makes sense.
By Alena on February 22, 2015
It is fairly soft although I'm not sure if it is as soft as the blanket. My cats really like sleeping on towels and I put towels on all the areas for comfort and also so I don't have to clean the platforms. Hope that helps!
By Kayla Cytron-Thaler on February 23, 2015
It is very soft. My cat is 7 years old, never had a Cat Tree before and he loves it.

Question:What is the toy hanging from the tree?
Answer:It's a Pom Pom toy, similar to something you can purchase at the store for them to bat, chase and play with. Only its attached to the cat tree. Our kitty loves it.
By Kinsey HeatherðŸ’‹ on November 4, 2017
Mine can with with two large fuzzy round pompoms. The cat loves them. The kind of are like 3-4" diameter round and with the elastic its like large version of the toy mice you get in the stores.
By Lauren Graybiel on November 4, 2017
It's a little ball. It comes with 2 of them. My cats snap it off within minutes each time I tie it on though.
By Cdeckro on November 4, 2017
A soft plush for batting.

Question:On the model a5201, can i attach two condo houses(one above the other)? doing some improvising for my two cats
Answer:Hi
The base dinmension is 16" X 16 with 3 support posts,the construction would be suitable for a condo house.
If you have two cats, we would suggest you consider the other model with two condo house.
By armarkat SELLER  on March 19, 2018
You should be able to, it has to holes on top for screws and bolts.
Just be careful not to make it top heavy:) hope that helps:)
By Blacklist Junkie on March 16, 2018
probably more trouble than it's worth as you would have to drill holes add extra pillars etc.
By C A Crossman on March 17, 2018
I am sorry but I don't know.

Question:What are the dimensions of the topmost platform?
Answer:Hi! The top platform is approximately 12" x 13Â½" and it has a small one inch lip around it. My cat is about 16 pounds and his butt hangs off the platform, but he seems happy with it! I was going to include a photo, but it seems I can't.

Question:I have the a5201 20"(l)x20"(w)x52"(h). how do i make it less wobbly? i don't think she could jump on it as it is.
Answer:We are sorry to hear that, would you please reassemble the cat tree according to the instructions again and make sure you place all the pieces in order and correct direction. Screw the connections tightly for the whole cat tree, also, please locate the cat tree in the bare floor or against the wall, it will be helpful. At last, we would like to remind you that the max holding weight for this cat tree is 20 lbs, if your cats are too feisty, itâ€™s better to choose a larger model. see less
By armarkat SELLER  on September 11, 2017
Our cat is about 5 lbs (a kitten). We have the tree against one wall in our Den. It is fairly stable; she jumps on it; all the way to the top, clawing into the cord on the way. It rocks a little, but is fairly stable. As she grows I believe she will be able to utilize it as she peaks out at 7-8 pounds. She really enjoys it and she has slept on it at all levers. A nice, well built product. No regrets. see less
By Tommy on September 8, 2017
Make sure to twist the upright pillars very tightly; you can do that after it is assembled. I found with mine that I could get several more turns. I have placed mine in a corner next to 2 windows, so it is a great place and out of the way. It still is a little wiggle-y but the cat doesn't seem to mind. Just now I was able to tighten the columns a little more. see less
By ellen f on September 8, 2017
I don't have the same one. I took my time while putting it together, making sure everything was tight as I go. You might want to try tightening everything again.
By Debra on September 9, 2017
I had to re-assemble some of the posts as I had screwed them in a bit crooked so try that and re-tightening with the allen wrench and put weights on the bottom
By Raxx on May 15, 2018
Question:I live in an apartment that is mostly carpeted. Is it still stable if placed on carpet?
Answer:Our tree was purchased about five years ago. It sits near a window in the living room of our apartment. Ashley has been known to take a running leap, too. I have tightend a post or two. We moved, so it got a good going over.
By Julie Vee on August 6, 2017
Yes, mine is on carpet and it is very stable. My cat loves it!
By Angela Strickler on November 19, 2016
I have mine on carpet but it is against a wall. Sometimes they take a running leap. I don't think it would tip over but I have 4 cats that use it. I think it's great. Really good product for the price. It dies get a little dirty though because of the color.
