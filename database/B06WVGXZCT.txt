Answer:Yes, it is good quality. Very soft material. Safe for pets, including small kittens and it was super easy to put together.

The quality is what one would expect for the price, it is quite sturdy and I have had no issues with the construction. My cat is fond of sitting on the middle shelf. When she jumps from the upper shelf directly to the floor the whole units tips over, so she's now smart enough not to do that!

It is not heavy enough. My tiny kitten knocked it over every time he jumped off of it so I finally had to just get rid of it. Definitely not good quality at all.

I recommend another store. This is the best quality I have ever bought. Fast delivery, reasonable price and good quality. If I need it, I will still buy it there. I bought it in this shop 𝐎𝐡𝐏𝐞𝐭𝟏𝟎𝟎.𝒄𝒐𝒎 👍👍👍

I have 3 cats. They used the scratching posts the most. My 8.8 lb cat used the tower but it was really too small for my boys that are 14 & 15lbs.

Question:What materials is this made from?
Answer:I would say a type of fannel material made specifically for animals.
By Treisha A. Krotzer on September 24, 2017
Particle board/wood, carpet, and sisal rope. You want to have it on a hard floor. The base is not big enough to keep it stable on carpet.

Question:Mine didn’t come with installation instructions. Where can I get them at?
Answer:I received sth like instructions in the package. It is simple
Just start from the lower level and put the sleeping room on that
Then you should fix the other parts through the stuff
It’s like a puzzle see less

There were instructions in my box. Maybe contact the sell for them to mail it or email it to you.
By Wendy Thomas on January 13, 2021
I did not get instructions either. I looked at the picture and then just puzzled it together.
By Sha55 on January 13, 2021
My son put mine together and I do think it came with instructions. We had one before just like it so he already had the basics.
FYI: My cat's love it.
By Mia on January 13, 2021
Mine didn't either but it wasn't hard at all! And Squeaky loves it.

I believe I just looked at the photo of the stand to figure out how it went together

Question:My cat tipped it over the first day of use. Is there any way to secure it so this can’t happen again?
Answer:If your cat doesn't use the hidey-hole space, you can put several heavy items in there as a counter balance. My cat tipped it over once and has since avoided the top shelf so it's not an issue.
By Kathy Slovachek on October 8, 2021
I would just put a weight of somesort in the bottom where the cat might crawl into. My kitty doesnt use the bottom so I could put all kind of weight there and probably would help with it tipping over. sorry not the best answer but all I could think of. My kitty loves the stand
By Harvin Langenbau on October 7, 2021
Make sure all the screws are twisted tightly. I’ve had mines for almost a year and I have to occasionally tighten the screws so it isn’t so wobbly. If it’s still tipping over then your floor might be tilted try putting it in a different room if that still doesn’t help.
By Dasia… on October 7, 2021
I would suggest putting it on a hard surface versus carpet

Question:How long for payment to process

By Lois M Rolfe on March 18, 2021
Question:It's woobaly and unstable is there a way to secure it?
Answer:Interesting, mine is very stable, if close to a wall position base against mop board, possibaly you need to tighten bolte
By Dadfigge on March 18, 2021
Mine was wobley, but it was because I could not get he screwes tight. My friend tightened and its perfect my kitty loves it.
By Lois M Rolfe on March 18, 2021
Question:How big of a cat will this handle?
Answer:Would be best for kittens and cats 5 pounds or less.
It’s not that big or sturdy. Perfect for kittens.
By Taking it with me on July 24, 2021
I purchased it for a large cat (18+ pounds) and it was way too small and flimsy for him. It wobbles back-and-forth and we had to put bricks on the bottom to keep it from flipping over. Would be fine for a much smaller kitty.
By Erin A on July 24, 2021
My cat weights 12 pounds and he sits on the top to look out of the window
By Anne Manning on July 24, 2021
To be honest this is better for smaller or slim cats.

Question:Is there any way to replace the ball attachment? Or recommendation to fix/reattach it?
