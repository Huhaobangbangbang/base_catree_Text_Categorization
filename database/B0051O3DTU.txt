Question:How wide is the hole on the third level?
Answer:The hole on the 3rd level is 6 3/4". The one on the bottom is 7".

I don't know exactly how wide it is. But my kitten is 9 months old and still fits through it with no problem. She loves it.
By Lisa on August 4, 2014
My 8lb, 1 year old cat fits through it, but she prefers to just climb straight to the top from the outside.

Question:Are the top and bottom halves of the post interchangeable? Tall cats would only use the top half - would get more use if could swap top and bottom.
Answer:I do not think they are interchangeable. However, the material is heavy duty, so it should last a long time. Also, our cats start at the bottom and scratch their way up, so they use the whole thing. All in all a great scratching post.

Id like to know this as well. I just put it together. It is sturdy.. BUT is it made for midget cats? My 5 pound runt calico can barely fit in the top cubby bin. Really disapointed i wasted my money

Question:Resort cat tower.. pros and cons?
Answer:Very cute but small. My cat couldn't lay in it. Perfect for kittens or small cats.

Hi, it was a great price compared to what the stores sell them for. My kitten uses it often, more so for the cat scratches that are also the pillars that hold it up/together

Question:How much assembly is required for this scratching post?
Answer:All parts are included. You will need a flat blade screwdriver. Using the provided machine screw, attach the lower part of the post to the base. Using the provided slotted threaded rod, attach the divider disk and upper part of the post to the lower part of the post (screw the rod into the lower part of the post, put the disk over the rod, and then screw the upper part of the post onto the rod). It takes about as long to read the directions as it does to assemble the unit. Our cats really love it, because they can stretch full length while grasping it. One of our cats likes to climb on top and perch. Since they have been able to use this post, they have done much less damage to the furniture. see less

Question:Forte scratching post... Does anyone know the size/thread of the screws??
Answer:I don’t know, but... we own 2 of these and they are built like a tank. One of our large “plus sized” cats runs toward it at top speed and dives up onto the side, landing at about the middle, then climbs up to the top and sits there for a minute as if to say “see what I can do”! This is a sturdy scratching post. All 4 of our cats seem to love this post. We would definitely buy it again. It isn’t perfect, but close. The only thing I would change is the brown thin carpeting... it does not seem very rugged, yet it is, in fact, still ok after about 6 months of daily use.

If you bought one and need to replace a bolt, just take it to any big box hardware store and they can tell you exactly what it is, which is probably a metric size bolt.

Note that this scratching post is BIG... really big! When we put our first one together, we were a little shocked by its size, but our cats love it, see less

Question:Is the post (under the rope) a cardboard tube, or a wooden post? Thanks.
Answer:I'm reasonably certain that it is wooden; the thing weighs a ton. No domestic cat is going to knock it over or destroy it easily!
By Jeff Dreibus on March 5, 2017
Based on the weight of the thing I think it's wood. It's a very good quality items. My cat loves it. He can climb it to sit on top and it is very sturdy. I would recommend it.
