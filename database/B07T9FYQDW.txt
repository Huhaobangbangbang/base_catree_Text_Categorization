Question:We are wanting to get a maine coon cat, will this size tree work for this large a breed?
Answer:Yes. I have had several Maine Coons, and currently have one and a long-hair super-floof mixed. The kitties love the variety of hang-out spots on this cat tree, and they fit just fine.

it is a very nice size, but I have a fatter cat who hangs over the sides. The other two cats fit on it nicely. The product is great, and the cats love it
By Debby Petrizzo on March 4, 2020
I have a small short haired domestic cat, and she fits comfortably. If your cat likes to be snuggled and in tight spaces being such a large breed, then yes, but if they prefer to stretch out then probably not.

If the cat will be anywhere from 15-20 lbs., I think it will be too small. Our cat is very long, and just fits in the hammock part. He cannot fit into the cubby hole , and he doesn't weigh any where near 15 lbs.
By Amazon Customer on March 5, 2020
No. They need more room to move around and this tree is quite constraining to large cats. Both my cats are 17lb tabbys

I have two cats that are 21 pounds...this is fine for them both!

Question:Do you think it's necessary to attach this to a wall? My cat weighs less that 7 pounds.
Answer:We have two cats which are both quite large and we do not have ours attached, however, it is near a wall so can not tip over but I see not evidence that it might. the cats love it. They use the scratch posts and jump on all sides, we also have a taller one next to it which adds to their fun. The tree seems to be wel… see more

No, I don't think it needs to be mounted to the wall. It has step levels that your kitten/cat will jump onto and they have pretty good balance. Just make sure it's on a leveled sturdy surface/floor and the kitten/cat should be fine.
By Patrice on November 15, 2019
No. My cat weighs 9 lbs. she is very active. It is against a wall and works out just fine.

Question:Can I leave off the cat scratch thing, i.e., not attach it?
Answer:You can but I think it adds to the non tipping if itree not attached to the wall
By Texas Gal on November 28, 2019
Question:Is it good for huge cats
Answer:How huge? Ralph is 11lbs and he fits but the top bed seems just a smidge too small for him when he sleeps. If your kitty is more that 11lbs- then no. Get a bigger tree. Quality of this company is good though.
By JackRabbitSlim on February 7, 2020
No the top basket is just big enough for my cat at 8 lbs. also the sisal or whatever the scratching post is covered with is all shredded and has to be replaced. Bought this in Oct 2019
By Texas Gal on February 10, 2020
This cat tree can holds 20lbs cats.
By Hey brother SELLER  on February 8, 2020
Yes has held up great so far for my almost 20 pound cat.
By Courtney on February 10, 2020
I would say no. Our “runt”, barely alive when we found her, kitten has found solace in the space between the cave and the platform, but she’s growing and not fitting there anymore. If you really mean HUGE then I would go bigger.
By Aimee Rogacki on February 8, 2020
No not really

Question:If the hammock is optional, does that mean that you simply don't attach it when you're assembling the tree?
Answer:You don’t have to add it to the tree. don’t add it to the tree If you don’t want it.
By Kate Rusu on August 9, 2020
Yes, there are three poles on the left side: bottom, middle, and top. The hammock goes between the middle and top if you don't have a hammock. Otherwise they go together and no one is the wiser.
By Bill B. on August 10, 2020
Yes. It’s easily assembled without the hammock.
By Lindsey Miller on August 9, 2020
I don’t know if that would work, however, the hammock is my cats favorite part.
