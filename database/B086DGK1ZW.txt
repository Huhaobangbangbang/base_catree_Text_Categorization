Question:Will this support a 13lb cat?
Answer:The best answer is yes, briefly. This product looks nice, is easy to put together, and inexpensive. It didn’t last very long. I got about a year out of it with it being somewhat tattered for the last few months. I used it for two small, very delicate kittens who are still quite petite fully grown. That being said, they used the heck ou t of it. If your cat is older or very chill, it will likely last longer for you. Hope this is helpful. see less
