Question:Does this come with extra poles in the case that you do not want to attach the scratching post?
Answer:Actually, the scratching post is the fourth pole in the base and is just as secure as the other poles. So far, our cats have ignored the scratching post because they are incredibly interested in the unit's "housing" options.

It does not come with extra poles. You may purchase other replacement scratching posts on Amazon.

Question:Is it easy to fold and put away?
Answer:No. This device is made to be fixed as a unit and it is un-foldable as there is no mechanism for folding it . However, if you do not glue the joints together, you can disassemble it fairly easily. My cat likes it very much as a unit and we play with it almost every day. It is very light and can be moved easily.
By Robert Cons on October 27, 2018
We're afraid it can't be folded. Thank you.

Not really meant to

Question:Is this ideal for larger cats?
Answer:I use it for kittens that I foster and they love it. Based on its size I would think it would be fine for larger cats.
By Donna G on August 24, 2018
My cat weighs about 17 lbs and fits in the top and loves it.
By Glenn on March 31, 2019
My 20 pound cat uses this without any issues. Just takes up the entire top area with not much room to move around.
By Delindlin on December 9, 2019
The max weight capacity is about 17.6 lbs.

Question:Is there any add-ons? sorry previous question worded wrong
Answer:I do not recall any add one available from the manufacturer. We shove your standard diameter tunnel and Y’s into the bottom opening at the front and the cat’s seem to like it. This piece of cat furniture is especially well suited for a couple of new kittens. A good “base camp” structure.

No. I do not.

Question:Is the material waterproof?
Answer:It is not waterproof.
By Banyan Imports on June 14, 2019
I am afraid it's not waterproof.
By Banyan Imports on October 31, 2018
Question:Would this withstand being outdoors?
Answer:I wouldn’t use it outdoors, but the material seems like it could withstand being outside in a protected area. It’s very lightweight, so strong wind gusts could be a problem.
By L. J. Sparkes on April 13, 2020
It depends on how long it would be outdoors. If you want to keep it out there permanently, then I would say no. If you're using it outside for one day then yes. It is made out of sturdy material and all the parts are plastic. However, I think the material would eventually deteriorate outside.
By Melanie on April 13, 2020
As others have stated, sturdy material and lightweight, which might be ok for temporary, but not for permanent uses. My cat does like to sleep in this occasionally. It's used more often than other sleep areas.
By AC on April 14, 2020
On a covered porch it would work. It is very light weight, so you could take it out on the grass for a while, but definitely not made for full-time out in the backyard.
By Amazon Customer on April 13, 2020
It is extremely light and would get blown away easily. Even if secured, it doesn't appear to be weather proof. I would not choose to put it outside.
By Infractus on April 14, 2020
Maybe on an enclosed porch—but not in the elements. It’s very light.
By WMB on April 13, 2020
Question:Is it hard to put together?
Answer:A little at first but you figure it out by reading the instructions.
It's well made, holding up under our patio.
By Miracle Detailing… on February 1, 2022
Not at all!
By Brianna H. on February 2, 2022
No pretty easy just follow directions
By Sylvia on February 1, 2022
Question:I know they don't sell replacement scratching posts, but has anyone had luck buying one elsewhere? If yes, which one did you buy?
Answer:I couldn't find one but I bought a spool of the rope and used hot glue to "resresh" it.

By Ann on February 13, 2021
Question:Is this ok to use outside?
Answer:I have it in a catio...it has a roof ...mid way... I wouldn't place it outdoors.. it's very light...a strong wind would blow it away..my cats love it..
By Diana on July 24, 2021
I probably wouldn't as it is not water proof and the connections do not seem to be as stable as you might want for an outdoor setting. My boy cat loves having this as a place to nap in my home office - he seems to think he is hiding in a snuggy spot.
By me on July 24, 2021
It’s pretty cheaply made. The bars are plastic so they don’t stay together too well. Also I bought it for adult cats and they are really too big for it
By Cindy P. on July 24, 2021
I would say yes you could but if it gets rained on to many times it would get ruined and probably smell because it has a soft bed inside it.
By Deborah Humphrey on July 24, 2021
It’s not waterproof. I keep it inside. Kitties love it. She sleeps on top too.
By Karen Weber on July 24, 2021
Yes, however be aware that the product is not waterproof.
