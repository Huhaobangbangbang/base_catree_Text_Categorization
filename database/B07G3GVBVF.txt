Question:I’ve got a real chonki boy. Is this this sturdy enough for a 20+ lb’er?
Answer:I have an approximately 12lb cat. 7 months in the top 2 support poles won’t tighten anymore but they sway. This isn’t sturdy on the most important levels.
By Wendy on May 19, 2020
I think it would be sturdy enough, but might just be too small in general. The platforms are pretty small and i don’t think will suit an overweight cat
By Bethany Bryan on January 9, 2019
It is very sturdy. My big boy doesn’t jump all the way up though
By Marta Crislip on January 10, 2019
My cat is 10lbs and this is definitely sturdy for her. Seems sturdy enough if assembled properly.
By GN on January 10, 2019
It’s extremely sturdy in my opinion

By Amazon Customer on December 23, 2019

Question:can be the box disassembled?
Answer:The tree cane unassembled. You must put it together. The box can be broken down.
By Kendall A. Moore on June 21, 2019
Yes it comes in pieces and you have to assemble it. You can also disassemble if needed once built.

Question:Will the beds fit an adult cat(15 lbs)?
Answer:No. My cat uses it, but he hangs out of it.
By Kathleen M. Baker on July 31, 2019
It's a squeeze. Our cats are large and they don't attempt to get on the beds.
By Julie on January 2, 2019
It would be a very tight squeeze
By Jaime Klotz on January 3, 2019
Yes, I would think so.
By Kathy Coy on December 30, 2018

Question:I ordered the multi platform and I cannot get the “house” to attach to the leg through the platform. Do I need to go buy a new bolt or any suggestio?
Answer:One of the screws is longer than the rest. This long screw is to be used to attach the house to the leg. It is possible that you used the long screw in a different place. Check to see.
By Aislin on September 29, 2019
The one I have looks a little different than this picture, but my legs and house attached to the platform through different holes. First the legs were secured to the bottom of the platform and then the house went on top. The house has an opening for bolt in the middle.
By Dee Dee Wilcox on September 29, 2019
Make sure the threads are not damaged on the bolt and the nut in the end of the tube/ See if the bolt will thread into the tube without the platform.
By Richard C. on September 30, 2019
I didn’t have any problems the only thing I can think of is are you using the right bolt to attach it. Wish I could be more help.

Question:What are the dimensions of the top perches (multi-platform style)?
Answer:The top porch is sort of like a box with very short walls. The interior is 12x12, exterior 13.75x13.75. cats like to sleep pressed up against walls so my cat loves to curl up in either of them.
By Erik on April 23, 2021
Very small. My large cat wont sit on them. Less than 12"
By Debbie Rogers on June 5, 2020

By Wendy on December 2, 2019
It’s about 2 ft wide and 4 ft tall.

Question:Would anyone recommend this kitty condo for a senior 3 legged cat?
Answer:Wow - 3 legs? Cats are cats no matter age and number of legs. Some cats like to climb more than others but my bet is the kitty would love it!! They’re amazing how curious and adventurous they are no matter age - a 3 legged cat doesn’t even know they normally have 4. I say go for it!
By Shirley on January 20, 2020
Honestly, my senior cat does not get up on this condo. Only my younger cat enjoys the condo. I would not recommend it for a senior three legged cat unless your kitty still has a lot of spunk in her/him. The height might be a problem.
By WBanegas on January 20, 2020
I would think the steps might help the 3 legged one /senior too. The little house provides an intermediate step to one of the platforms so that's a help
By PT in NC on January 20, 2020
Yes, I highly recommend it. My cat loves it at first he did not have much interest, but then he would not get off. It’s easy to assemble. Good luck!
By Monica Jovel on January 20, 2020
I would say yes, it’s very stable and sturdy and an adult car can hop from level to level without really having to fully jump.
By Jennifer G. on January 20, 2020
It’s kind of challenging even for my 5 & 6 year olds tbh. It’s very vertical without a lot of ledges. You could try it.
