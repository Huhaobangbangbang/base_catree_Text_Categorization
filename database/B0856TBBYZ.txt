Question:Is this the same unicorn cat tree that sells on here for 10$ cheaper?
Answer:Not sure which one you‚Äôre looking at, I bought the zebra one, but If you can find it cheaper I‚Äôd say go for it. It‚Äôs a good tree and all but it‚Äôs already cheap and cheaply made, I would say 10 dollars less isn‚Äôt going to make a difference go cheap
