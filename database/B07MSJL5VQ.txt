Question:Is the tube holding up top platform is made of wood or cardboard?
Answer:It‚Äôs lightweight but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs cardboard. I‚Äôve got 9 cats including several 15 pounders. They climb all over the top tier and so far it‚Äôs holding up well. This is the only pedestal unit I‚Äôve found that is plus size in terms of the perches and condos. I recommend it.

I'm at work, but I'm pretty sure all the tubes are all made of the same thing. VERY heavy duty cardboard type material. Very sturdy. However, if your cats are able to shred the rope, don't be lazy like me. Replace the rope!! Because eventually, they can sharpen their claws right into that cardboard. (I have this tree and 2 others) Good luck! see less

Not 100% but it feels like heavy cardboard

Question:Is it possible to purchase replacement parts due to wear and tear? Specifically a post and platform? Trying to avoid replacing the whole structure to
Answer:You can repair the scratch pole with sisal rope that can be purchased either on Amazon or at Walmart. It is very easy and I've repaired several poles for my cats. The platform can be repaired as well by wrapping the sisal rope or use a plush fabric or baby blanket to wrap it around and secure with staple gun making sure to avoid the areas where kitties stand. There are YouTube videos on how to repair both. see less

Question:Can I make 2 smaller trees with this? I don‚Äôt want to make it so tall
Answer:It looks like if you didn't attach the second level 3 beams it would be in 2 pieces but you would need some flat bottom screws for those places where the beams would connect the levels instead of the connector screws

Question:Does it wobble or shake if two large 16 pounds and 20 pounds cats go bat shit crazy and run and climb if kept in the middle of the room without walls?
Answer:I have 11 cats who are already going crazy because it is already winter in Maine and it is too cold to for them outside. Two of them are crazy kittens who chase my fat older cats around. It is very sturdy and I didn't even tether it to the wall. I do have it on a hard wood floor and not carpet.
By Caralyn Loucka King on November 26, 2019
It's very sturdy but it would shake/wobble just a little bit, especially with the size of those cats. My cats (5) are huge and 4 of them learned to slow their pace instead of just insanely launching full force to and from it. One of the cats is now scared to death of it because it moved....cats are weird :) but the others love it. I finally moved it so it is touching the wall. see less
By DoggedTX on November 26, 2019
Its has a short tie strap that secures it to the wall
By CrasH on November 26, 2019
Yes, it will. It needs to be up against a wall and preferably anchored.

Question:I read that the inside of the condos do not have carpet attached. Is this correct and if so why?
Answer:Inside the condos are covered but are not carpeted or cushioned, like the rest of the perches. We have added our own cushioning, and our cats love the cat tree.
By Anon on July 6, 2019
There is carpet inside the condos
By Sara on July 6, 2019
