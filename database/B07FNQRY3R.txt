Question:How much weight can it support at once? I may or may not have a fattichubs who likes to sit on others to get his way.
Answer:This thing is really, really sturdy. We have two, uh, furry fattichubs. I think they could easily stack up and it'd support their weight without falling over or collapsing. It comfortably fits one 18-pound fattichub.

Question:It says the material is fleece but doesn't look like it. How well does this material hold up
Answer:We've had this cat tree for 6 months now, and it's holding up very well. The cats scratch it daily, and take naps in the top. The material is sturdy.
By Krista L. on November 3, 2020
It is fleece, except the posts. The posts are covered with scratching material that looks and feels like rolled paper. My cat is only scratching the posts, so I have no problems with fleece (except it‚Äôs hard to vacuum or otherwise clean it, because it‚Äôs like a magnet for cat hair).
By Natalia Dominguez on November 3, 2020
Holds up very well. I've had mine for a few months and it still looks like new. It also comes with a nice quality cat toy.
By Ray Quigley on November 3, 2020
Its more like matt finish my cat doesn't use it at all. The fabric is to rough
By jose tirado on November 4, 2020
It has held up well for me and I have a large, wrecking ball cat who is very playful and very young with very sharp claws between trims. No tearing so far.
By Sylvia S. Steimke on November 4, 2020
The. Fabrics is ok
It falls over a lot
Base too too small. Cats still play onit on side

i don't sell these - i just bought one

That would be a question for the seller.

Question:Does the paper rope hold up to heavy scratching use? Does it shred or fall apart?
Answer:Paper rope does hold up! Our cat immediately ripped off the ball though.
By Alling Langin on March 17, 2019
Don't understand how people say this paper rope lasts. Tear is immediate. The posts in our cat tree were considerably damaged after less than 24 hours. Real rope is much more durable.
By Susana Anacleto-Lupianez on February 9, 2020
It holds up fairly well and definitely does not make a mess the way twine rope does.
By Jennifer S. on March 17, 2019
Question:Can this be set up on covered back porch?
Answer:don't know why not. Ours is set up in the lanai - no problems - kitty loves it
By Mike on December 3, 2019
I have this one. I think your cat would love to have this tower. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want it to get wet if it happens to rain
By Ron Marsh on December 2, 2019
I believe so but I am not sure if the material will get too warm to the touch, I live in Florida so it would be too warm if outside.
By escapeinmybookshelf on December 3, 2019
I think as long as it's kept out of any weather conditions, yes, but it's definitely an indoor product. I wouldn't allow it to get wet as it would ruin it. Hope this is helpful!
By L. Vitro on December 3, 2019
Yes, just make sure don't make it contact any water.
By Catry Professional Cat Tree Co‚Ä¶ SELLER  on December 2, 2019
Yes

Question:Can you get replacement posts?
Answer:Not that I know of. I've had mine for almost 10 months and it's holding up well. But I only have one cat. I've never heard of a cat tree company selling replacement posts.

Question:How long is the top platform? I have a large cat and worried it might not be big enough.
Answer:just measured mine...13in wide and 15in long...my cat is prob between medium and large (closer to large...she's fat ü§™üòÇ) and she fits easily. idk the size of your cat but you should be fine. it's also nice and sturdy..I've had mine for about 6 months and it still looks great!
By Ray Quigley on December 20, 2020
The round platform is 12" in diameter. The hammock is 15-1/2" long. My cat skips the round platform and jumps directly into the hammock.
By catlover on December 18, 2020
Top is 15‚Äù long x 13.25‚Äù wide across the top.
By christy j on December 20, 2020
This cat tree is better suited for a smaller cat. I don't have the exact measurement at them moment, as I'm at work - but I have a young cat who is growing bigger and he never lays in it anymore.
By mmmking4 on December 18, 2020
It's 16 inches across. It's a decent size and both my cats love it, though they are on the smaller size.
By Jaimee Rindy on December 18, 2020

Question:Does it come with any cat toys?
Answer:Yes, there is a cat wand toy included in the package.
By Catry Professional Cat Tree Co‚Ä¶ SELLER  on July 13, 2020
The attached swinging pom pom is one, and they send a toy that is attached to a stick that you and your cat can play together with.
By Patootie on July 12, 2020
No, but there is a little jingly ball hanging from it for cats to play with.
By Sarah on July 13, 2020
No extra toys, just the one that hangs as pictured.
By lovemykids05 on July 12, 2020
There is a ball hanging from the top like in the picture and a separate mouse on a string with a stick (need a person to play)

Question:Mine is missing instruction manual. Can someone please post?
Answer:The pieces can only fit one way. The two long poles screw into the u-shaped perch from the bottom. I turned it upside -down to assemble. The small poll screws into the little circle, all three polls screw into the bottom. Don't tighten everything until you finish putting together.
