question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: The platform is big enough that my cat has never knocked it over so I would say, no, you don't have to screw it to the floor.
question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: Weeelll....I Have not had to, but I DID put two fairly large rocks around the post.My smaller catz hang from it as shown in the photo. What DID happen to both(we have two)was the post separated from the base.Easy effective fix...Gorilla glued both pieces and re-assembled. They are still one piece. Hope this helps. see less
question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: I didn't but I think that would depend on the size of your car. I have the base against the baseboard and it doesn't move when my cat uses it.
question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: Not at all. The platform makes the pole very steady. I've had this for over a year now; my kitty uses it several times a day, and it has never tipped over.
question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: No it has a wide base. My cats run at it and climb up it with no problem.
question:Do you have to screw it to the floor in order not to fall over?    answer: No it's really stable and I have a large cat
question:Width of poles?    answer: The pole meaures 3-1/2" in diameter and 10-1/4" in circumference.
question:Width of poles?    answer: Without finding my vernier calipers, the closest I could measure was 3.4 inches, give or take one-tenth of an inch.
question:Does your cat love this?    answer: Love is a strong word, but I would say my cats use this. And in doing so, they don’t scratch the furniture.
question:Does your cat love this?    answer: Both my cats use it several times a day. It’s holding up very well so far!!
question:Does your cat love this?    answer: Yes,they do THIS one is tall enough they can stretch. One thing... the 1st one I got the post "broke" at the base.They can be rough..my boys. I simply applied gorilla glue..set it aside for a couple days...all better. 1 more thing...they try to hang from it...i just put a couple big rocks on base. I recommend it. see less
question:4 CATS - None under 18 pounds - will this product hold up to, say, 3 at a time boxing each other for top floor? It's what I hoped for if it works.    answer: Let me start by saying I LOVE this cat tree- it's nice to look at, goes together easy. We have several cats under 18 pounds, and as the tree comes right out of the box, ***I*** wouldn't trust it to not tip over. BUT, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and placed a very heavy stone (in this case, a granite block- probably in the 75-100 pound vicinity) on the base, and now I trust the tree completely not to tip over. see less
question:4 CATS - None under 18 pounds - will this product hold up to, say, 3 at a time boxing each other for top floor? It's what I hoped for if it works.    answer: It's quite sturdy, my 2 cats play on it together and it holds really well. Tbh my cats are both under 9 pounds lol I would put something heavy on the bottom to keep it steady. The good thing is that there are a lot of polls for them to grab and play, not too many platforms in the way of the climbing.
question:4 CATS - None under 18 pounds - will this product hold up to, say, 3 at a time boxing each other for top floor? It's what I hoped for if it works.    answer: Unfortunately, we can not recommend if this item would work for your needs at this time.
question:4 CATS - None under 18 pounds - will this product hold up to, say, 3 at a time boxing each other for top floor? It's what I hoped for if it works.    answer: No. That's too much weight
question:What are the posts made of?    answer: Sisal wrapped post.. Post are made of heavy plastic.. I own two this style and another larger one from the same company.. I love the solid wood construction.
question:What are the posts made of?    answer: The posts appear to be made of plastic core, covered with a layer of cardboard-like material, over the top of which sisal rope is tightly wound. The only part of the posts that is visible is the sisal rope.
question:What are the posts made of?    answer: Hi, They are made of paper tubes with sisal rope. Thanks. Helen,
question:What are the posts made of?    answer: Per the description Made with original grain, Pinus Sylvestris polished wood
question:What are the posts made of?    answer: Hum I think it's sisal material.
question:Is the height 89” from the base all the way to the top of the house? Also, is it too wobbly, or still stand with one 13-14 pound Norwegian forest cat?    answer: Yes, you are right. The height 89" is from the base to the top of the house. The max holding weight for this model is 80lbs. So it is sturdy enough for 13-14 pound cats. To make it more stable, you can try to tigten it after months use.
question:Is the height 89” from the base all the way to the top of the house? Also, is it too wobbly, or still stand with one 13-14 pound Norwegian forest cat?    answer: Yes, the height is from base to top of highest box. It's not wobbly at all. It has handled my 18 lb cat chasing my 14 lb cat up and down it with no issues at all. I've now bought a total of seven different towers by this company because they are so well built.
question:How strong is the wood scent? Does it dissipate over time?    answer: There is no strong scent to the wood.
question:How strong is the wood scent? Does it dissipate over time?    answer: I didn't notice any strong wood smell, or I completely forgot I did. I remember opening the box you could obviously smell the wood as it was all boxed up and without air but once it was out, I seriously do not recall any smell lingering. It's a great tree, my cats love it.
question:How strong is the wood scent? Does it dissipate over time?    answer: I don't notice one.
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: They are right between 1/2 and 2/3 of an inch thick.
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: Hi, The thickness of the wood boards is 2" Thanks. Helen,
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: The boards are a little bit thicker than 1/2 an inch. My cats LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cat tree -- and it looks very nice too (much better than the "typical" kind covered in carpet. I highly recommend it!
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: 1/2" boards as well as the wooden houses... Finished edges.. Very well constructed. I own 4 of these trees.
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: 1.2 inches (3 cm)
question:What is the thickness of the wood boards?    answer: Approximately 1/2"
question:can it be used on a large covered front porch?    answer: Hi, The dimensions are 48.8 x 14 x 89 inches, please compare it with the porch's dimensions and confirm if the cat tree can be used.
question:can it be used on a large covered front porch?    answer: It is made from plywood and NOT particle board, so YES. My cats love it. I put beds on the two large shelves which are now their favorite sleeping spot. Worth every penny.
question:can it be used on a large covered front porch?    answer: I don't see why not but I would still be concerned that it would get wet.
question:can it be used on a large covered front porch?    answer: Sure.
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: Hi, The base dimension is 24"*19". Overall size 34"*49", means the longest length and width for assembled cat tree. The dimension of oversize is mostly decided by the edge of the perches. The perche and house stretch out a little, and they make the overall size bigger than the base plate. Hope the explanation is clear.
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: Hello...  The base size is 14" x 23". Height is 89".  This is a very high quality unit. None of the previous cat trees we've had compare with the Armarkat. It is well worth the price.  Paul  This unit is made with very high-grade plywood.  Paul Yoder see less
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: The base is 19 x 23. This is a very sturdy and stable tree. My 4 cats love it and so far I’ve been more than happy I got it. I’ve had other trees over the years and none have been this good; it was worth the money. Didn’t take long to put together. My only complaint is, the wooden platforms are too slick and I had to put a type of low level carpet on them so the cats could get traction. I’d give it a 5-star rating. see less
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: That is correct it is not 49,i dont know exactly.im not there but thats wrong
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: It's approx 19"x 23". Don't let that deter you though. This cat tree is the bomb dot com. Seriously though. My cats love it.
question:What is the size of the base? From the photos, it does not appear to be 14" x 49", as listed.    answer: It's 19" x 23"
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: I have my cat tree next to the wall on a flat ️uncarpeted floor.. But it would be very useful to fasten to the wall to prevent it from being pushed or pulled over.. I could see where a child might try and climb on it and it could fall over.
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: I placed a large block of granite on the base to keep it from tipping. I see others didn't have an issue, but I just didn't trust it enough to not stabilize it in some way. Anchoring it to the wall would be peace of mind, for sure.
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: No need to anchor it's very sturdy. Best tree I have gotten.
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: You probably could. Keep in mind that the top cube juts out, I. E. It is not flush with the back of the platform or the back of the other levels.
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: You could if you wanted too. However we didn't see a need to as this tree is very sturdy. It's never tipped over even with my cats racing up and down.
question:Why wouldn't you use a furnature anchor to brace it tight against a wall?    answer: You could if you wanted too. However we didn't see a need to as this tree is very sturdy. It's never tipped over even with Mt cats racing up and down.
question:Is there a way to place the bottom box "house" more towards the top?    answer: Hi, Sorry, we could not place the bottom box "house" more towards the top, as the stability was considered when designed.
question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.    answer: My cats (3 a year old cats) love it and we love it. They climb onit, play on it, sleep in the and on the upper box. Unfortunately the other box we installed (by instruction) on the lower part of the tree. Cats don't use it and that one is bigger box. Two cats can get together in the upper box. One of my cats like to scratch the scratchers. They don't mind being on wood, so we didn't put any mat. You can easily put one if you want. It looks very beautiful and matches our built in cabinets. We are very happy that we purchased this cat tree. I have a nice video of my cats playing there, which I am planning to post in manufacturers website. Hope my answer helped you make a decision. Smiles! see less
question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.    answer: Cats are comfortable on bare wood, they love trees after all, beware potential splinters if you remove the carpet from this tower, because it won't be treated wood. Ultimately, the cats will love the height from this tower, it's the best gift anyone can give a cat.
question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.    answer: My cats use the wood more for climbing up to the next platform, but you could attach a bed or fabric of your choice with Velcro to the wood.
question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.    answer: It seems like the bare wood surfaces take some getting used to, especially if the tree is a bit unstable. Given some time your cats will adjust to it, especially if it can be made stable, say set in a corner and on a hard surface. I might note that the Aramark at cat trees are very well made of extremely high grade (9-ply) plywood and simple enough to assemble with their instructions. see less
question:Are the cats comfortable on the bare wood? I do not want carpet, but was hoping a small mat/pad could be securely attached to provide more comfort.    answer: They are comfortable when reposing (and they looooove the hammock) but they do slip around on the wood if they jump on at speed, sometimes even leaving scratches as they try to arrest their momentum. I definitely think this would be improved by some carpeting, although I am happy with it generally and they certainly don't avoid it. see less
question:How big is the box it's delivered in?    answer: I don't remember the exact measurements. It's definitely on the big box side. Not rectangular, but a box. Maybe like a large moving box?
question:How big is the box it's delivered in?    answer: It's pretty large, if I remember, probably 2 1/2' x 2 1/2' x 2'
question:How big is the box it's delivered in?    answer: Extra large, and you have to assemble it.
question:How big is the box it's delivered in?    answer: As I recall it was near 36" square.
question:Does anybody have declawed cats using this tree?    answer: No. I have 2 of these and 10 cats, all with claws. These are super wobbly and cannot be tightened enough to make them stable. They must be secured to a wall and ceiling or to the wall in 2 places. Stability will be even more important for declawed cats. I definately like the "no carpet" feature of this tree. So much easier to clean. Cats love the hammock feature and the house at the top. see less
question:Does anybody have declawed cats using this tree?    answer: NO, who does that to cats these days?
question:Does anybody have declawed cats using this tree?    answer: Yes front only but i have other towers next to it. Planks are solid wood, but he likes it.
question:What is the size of the box with the hole?    answer: I would say about 20" x 20", the whole is maybe 10" wide, my big cat has a little hard time to fit in, for my smaller one its perfect
question:What is the size of the box with the hole?    answer: The measurements are given in the description but if that doesn't help I can tell you that my 17 pound cat can fit in it, turn around, and has room to spare. I hope that helps a little. As for the tube attached to the bottom, it is large enough around for the cats to fit through but very short across only a few inches. None of them ever play with it. see less
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: I have a 15 and 20 pound cat, they fit in it fine. The 20 pound cat loves to sit inside the middle part. Hope this helps
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: I do not recommend this model for medium or larger cats. My heaviest cat is under 11 lbs. It lasted 6 months and one of the posts snapped off, making a huge crash. Cats are okay but this model is not good quality.
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: 2 of my cats are in the same range. My larger cat overlaps his preferred bed. Mine use it to sleep on - no rough play at the moment but the base is big enough to be sturdy.
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: Hi Jean-Maybe if the cats were on one at a time. My cat is 11 pounds, and does sleep in the "house" area and lays on the middle level. I would think your 13 pounder would fit in the house. The two top beds are good size for a curled up cat. Mine does not go on those levels at all for some reason. The bottom is good size, even for a larger cat. Good luck! Vicki see less
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: I only have one cat about 13 lbs and there would be enough room for 2. the only problem I have is that my cat doesn't use the round tubular thing under the platform
question:I have two cats-13 lb and 20 lb. Would this be big enough for them or what would be?    answer: Jean, I think this should be good for 2 cats. Although I only have one, the tower seems too much for just him sometimes.
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: The beds are indeed 13". There is about 1/2" of foam padding all the way around too which makes it look more like 14".
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: The beds are indeed 13". There is about 1/2" of foam padding all the way around too which makes it look more like 14".
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: Dixie- I'm not at my house right now but I think I could safely estimate 12 inches. This structure is so much sturdier than the one it replaced. I felt the cost was very fair for the quality. Oh, and I don't work for the company! Ha
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: They are 13 inches
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: They are 13 inches
question:What is the diameter of the two cat beds at the top?    answer: 1 foot
question:The 3 "branches" with the hanging balls - are they rigid or bendable? Would you think it could be a risk for them to jump into and get hurt? Can the branch things be left off without adversely affecting the rest?    answer: They are bendable. The cats are smart enough not to jump onto them, so I'm not sure why you're concerned. If you're afraid of it, you can just not install it to begin with, it screws on. The biggest safety issue with this unit is the support posts are cardboard tubes that are not securely attached to their screw-on bases. They become wobbly over time, then fall down. If you over-tighten them, you will snap the plastic base and it'll fall off as well. Mine lasted 6 months with an under 11 lb. cat. It looks horrible, the fabric tears with one good swipe of a claw. Junk. see less
question:The 3 "branches" with the hanging balls - are they rigid or bendable? Would you think it could be a risk for them to jump into and get hurt? Can the branch things be left off without adversely affecting the rest?    answer: The three branches are flexible. My cats sit on top of that corner cubby (if that's what you want to call it) and reach to play with the balls, which have bells in them. My cats play pretty rough and I've never had a problem with them jumping into that area. The two beds and the branch piece screwed into a double sided… see more
question:The 3 "branches" with the hanging balls - are they rigid or bendable? Would you think it could be a risk for them to jump into and get hurt? Can the branch things be left off without adversely affecting the rest?    answer: As my kittens are getting older and longer they are starting to use the balls hanging from the post. The posts are flexible. They are not at such a height that a kitten is likely to get injured falling from the platform. My cats are also starting to use the upper scratching post and sleep on the upper platforms.
question:The 3 "branches" with the hanging balls - are they rigid or bendable? Would you think it could be a risk for them to jump into and get hurt? Can the branch things be left off without adversely affecting the rest?    answer: Rigid , could get hurt you would have to cut off with a saw?
question:The 3 "branches" with the hanging balls - are they rigid or bendable? Would you think it could be a risk for them to jump into and get hurt? Can the branch things be left off without adversely affecting the rest?    answer: Well I sent mine back as they hated the fabric on the post. It is not carpet and it had a smell to it they did not like. Would not go on it. They are ridged and my cats are active. I have one that is much smaller than this and no problems. I would say go for one with carpet.
question:what is the weight limit?    answer: It did not give a weight limit but our cat weighs 3 lbs. and I had to retighten it after she used it for two months. The base is pretty sturdy so if your cat weighs less than 8 pounds it should be ok.
question:what is the weight limit?    answer: My two cats weight about 12 lbs together and like to sleep on the top nest together. After about almost three months of usage, the bed is starting to tilt. Also, the base is a little small for two cats to play on.
question:what is the weight limit?    answer: Don't know really...I have 2 young cats that hang out together in the top nest together ...most likely they weigh 15 pounds together. Cat DOES have to be rather athletic to get to the top so if they are lazy it might be too high!
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: Yes, it would be good for a kitten, not good at all for an adult cat.
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: This would be an excellent choice for your kitten. We actually got it when one of our cats was a kitten. I guess he still is a kitten, he's only 5 months but he is huge because he's a Maine Coon. We also have an adult Maine Coon and a domestic shorthair. It's very sturdy. All three of them are always on it together. It's great because when he was a kitten, he would crawl up the little ramp. see less
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: I don't see why not! It's large enough that my large cat loves it and can fit in the beds, so your kitten would be able to grow into it and have fun in the meantime. It's not overwhelmingly large for a kitten to handle. What specifically are you concerned about..?
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: It would be fine, however I do not recommend this cat tree as less than a year later my carpet is all off because it's so cheap.
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: My cat (almost a year old now) has ripped off one of the dangle balls. We tied a new dangle ball on, which works fine, except he's determined to bungee jump with them & its only a matter of time, before they are all replacement dangle balls. We have had this tree since late February & this thing has done nothing but boost his ability to channel his feral inner-kitty since literally the moment assembly began. Totally worth every cent, for that alone. The cubby in the middle doubles as a toy box, when you find all their forgotten dingle balls under the couch. My older cat (approx. 10 human years) thoroughly enjoys every level, as well, just with a little more couth. see less
question:Would this be a good cat tree for an american shorthair kitten?    answer: Yes. My cat is an American shorthair. She loves this. Lays on the top perch all the time!
question:What is the height from the base to the bottom of the house? Is it tall enough for a grown cat to stretch up and claw on the post, stretching?    answer: About 19". My cat is 1 1/2 yrs old an she uses all 5 of the scratching surfaces. She prefers the front right post. Before I bought this, she was using my carpet.
question:What is the height from the base to the bottom of the house? Is it tall enough for a grown cat to stretch up and claw on the post, stretching?    answer: If I understand what you are asking, it is 20" from the base to the "landing" that the box with the hole in it sits. None of my cats can scratch on the post beside the box from the base, it is too tall for them. I found that each of the scratching post sections are just about right for grown cats to use. It is a little wobblie on the top perch, but I solved that by putting the cat tree against the wall with the perch touching the wall. That stabilizes the perch. All three of my cats love this cat tree. They each use it differently, but they can all be found on it at one time or another during the day. see less
question:What is the height from the base to the bottom of the house? Is it tall enough for a grown cat to stretch up and claw on the post, stretching?    answer: It's about 18 inches from the floor to the bottom of the house. My cats don't do much with the circular hanging thing under the house, but they are tearing this thing up! They are even playing with the toys (which I didn't think they would) and sleep all over it. On top of the house is a favorite spot.
question:What is the height from the base to the bottom of the house? Is it tall enough for a grown cat to stretch up and claw on the post, stretching?    answer: Me have a Maine Coon Cat that measures three feet from nose to tip of tail and this structure works great.
question:What is the height from the base to the bottom of the house? Is it tall enough for a grown cat to stretch up and claw on the post, stretching?    answer: Its about two feet maybe a little more its big enough for a grown cat, its fairly large. but my cat loves it, like its her own but she never uses the scratching parts on it at all, my cat was older when she got it so she doesn't know theres scratchers on it, a kitten probably would though, i recommend this one because its really high quality, for the price. see less
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: My kitten still scratches my couch too, but my kitten likes to crawl and scratch everything including crawling up the screens on my windows. You might try sprinkling some cat nip on it.
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: Catnip! I put a little in the perches and on the toys and now she never gets off the tree (even when there's no catnip on it).
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: Play with your kitten on the post. Make sure the post is sturdy. As a groomer and cat rescuer make sure you also cut your kitties nails about once a month to save your furniture and cat post. Keep trying most kitties love playing and sleeping on a nice cat post. Some kittens just need time. However, remember that most kitties love all the furniture in the house so if your goal for the cat post is to keep the baby off the rest of the furniture that may or may not happen. Good luck and welcome to being owned by a cat! see less
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: Any time you find your kitty scratching furniture, firmly tell them NO, and place them on the tree and tell them what a good baby they are. There are also many products designed to stop furniture scratching that you can use to discourage the NO areas. Some cats do not react to Catnip, so for them put reward treats on the tree to encourage climbing. I know when I shake the treat can, my kitty comes running.....so get their attention and then place the treats and praise your baby while on the tree..... see less
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: Try sprinkling some cat nip on it. It took my two cats awhile to get used to it.
question:My american shorthair kitten doesn't use this tree much. How do i get her more interested in this vs my furniture?    answer: Give it time.
question:They kitty towers are super wobbly, is there a fix for that?    answer: I purchased two of these; one for my big boy and one for my granddaughters two big kitties. Once all the legs were tightened, there were no problems and the kitties love their perch to play on and sleep on as well.
question:They kitty towers are super wobbly, is there a fix for that?    answer: Maybe use the Allen wrench provided to make it more sturdy. I tightened them well and I've had no problem with the sturdiness of this cat tower.
question:They kitty towers are super wobbly, is there a fix for that?    answer: We would suggest contacting the manufacturer directly to verify.
question:What is the return policy for this item?    answer: I don't know. We have never had a problem and this is the second one we bought.
question:Is it easy to put together?    answer: Yes very easy to put together. Absolutely love it great buy!
question:Is it easy to put together?    answer: It was! The kitties helped Daddy and played in the box. It was done in less than an hour. My kitties use it daily.
question:Is it easy to put together?    answer: It's not difficult if you have a reasonable level of "construction" knowledge. The printed directions are probably average in terms of "Made in China, translated into English" and it will take you about half an hour. There are a few places where it's very helpful to have a second human to assist.
question:Is it easy to put together?    answer: Yes, my dad and brother put it together in less than thirty minutes.

question:Has anyone had a problem with a cat tipping over when scratching or being unstable? Thanks!    answer: I have a big cat, about 24 lbs.

question:How deep are these shelves? is there a weight capacity? i have a 20lb miane coon.    answer: The Cat Mod shelves are 11" in depth. Our solid wooden shelves will hold up to 84lbs when installed according to our instructions. We have also done a lot of weight testing on our items to make sure they work for the majority of cats. As long as the shelves are mounted into at least one stud they held a great deal of weight; though the hammock pieces need to be mounted into studs with each plank to achieve the same sturdiness. see less
question:How deep are these shelves? is there a weight capacity? i have a 20lb miane coon.    answer: 11" deep and my 15 pound male is fine on them with another cat. We have them mounted into the studs on the walls for the added support.

question:Would this shelf be large enough to fit a cat and a feeder dish?    answer: This shelf is 34" W and 11" D. It will definitely fit a cat. As far as the feeder dish goes, if you're referring to a standalone feeder dish to set on top of the shelf then that will depend on the dish. If you're referring to the add-on Cat Mod Feeder then this can connect directly to either end of this 34" Shelf. - https://www.amazon.com/CatastrophiCreations-Handcrafted-Elevated-English-Chestnut/dp/B071RTVY5G?ref_=bl_dp_s_web_16069839011 see less
question:Would this shelf be large enough to fit a cat and a feeder dish?    answer: This is a very large shelf. Our cat loves it! There is definitely space to put a food bowl while allowing even a large cat to sit or lie down.
question:Is there fabric material (for cats to grip) on the top-face of the shelf?    answer: This item does not have any fabric attached to the top of it, but your cat should be able to grip and find traction on the shelf just fine! We sand the furniture tops with a rough finish for increased traction and leaving the sides and bottoms sanded fine for a clean, finished look.
question:Is there fabric material (for cats to grip) on the top-face of the shelf?    answer: no, but there is a lot of texture in the wood. It's not slippery at all but it also doesn't cause slivers. It's hard to explain but they don't need material to grip on. They can get enough traction on the wood alone. My cats use them all the time and have no issues.
question:Is there fabric material (for cats to grip) on the top-face of the shelf?    answer: No. That would make it even better. You'd have to add your own.
question:Is there fabric material (for cats to grip) on the top-face of the shelf?    answer: Not in the pieces I purchased
question:I want to install this under a window. if centered, i won’t be able to mount this on studs. can i use anchors?    answer: You can install our 18"/34" Shelves and 18"/34" Escape Hatches with one bracket into a stud and the other bracket with anchors and still have a very sturdy hold. However, we don't recommend using anchors for both brackets with this product.
question:I want to install this under a window. if centered, i won’t be able to mount this on studs. can i use anchors?    answer: You can use anchors but depending on the weight of your cats and the amount of use the shelves may start to loosen even with the achors.
question:Does anyone have a picture of the brackets and/or installation? I'm not clear on how these attach to the wall.    answer: Our furniture mounts using hidden brackets which gives the furniture its floating look when installed. On the top of the shelf are two pairs of screws that, when removed, release the plank bottoms. These plank bottoms have the hidden brackets pre-attached. If you'd like to message us, we'd be happy to send photos for clarification. see less
question:Is there space for a cat to turn around? I want them to be able to exit the shelf the same side they enter from.    answer: All of our bamboo items have a standard depth of 11" and we haven't received any feedback regarding cats having a difficult time turning on the furniture. The furniture is tested by the owners' cats, a few of whom are large-breed, so your cat should have no trouble maneuvering on the 34" Shelf!  If you do encounter any issues, please feel free to reach out to us directly and we'd be happy to help! see less
question:Is there space for a cat to turn around? I want them to be able to exit the shelf the same side they enter from.    answer: Yes and I have fairly large cats too, they should easily be able to get up and down from the same side. They look nice as well
question:Is there space for a cat to turn around? I want them to be able to exit the shelf the same side they enter from.    answer: It is a little narrow, but I have a really large cat and he seems to have no issues turning around and lying down. Personally, I am thinking about adding some carpeting for traction because the smooth wood makes me nervous. But my cat doesn't seem to mind at all,
question:Is there space for a cat to turn around? I want them to be able to exit the shelf the same side they enter from.    answer: I have a fat adult and he could turn around, no problem.

question:When cats scratch the cat tower's post, will it break the rope?    answer: Honestly, my cat doesn't use it that often but its pretty durable. It hasn't messed up the foundation or anything.
question:How is the ramp held on ?    answer: The ramp is held on by one bolt. Its the same bolt that holds the white rope wrapped post at top of ramp. The post is on top of the ramp and top post and ramp are connect to the bottom white roped wrapped bottom post. With ramp connected by one bolt it lets the ramp be swiveled it space is a issue. The ramp solid at least it has remained solid in the little over a month I have had this cat tree. Its a well built product for the price and I got free shipping that really real worth the price I paid. I should add I have 2 cats who this cat tree is for one is on the portly side around 10 lbs and other cat is little like a peanut is weighs less then 7 ibs. With the weight of both cats using this cat tree has not yet effected the structure of cat tree so far. see less
question:How is the ramp held on ?    answer: If I remember correctly, there are 2 brackets that you screw onto that first platform. It for sure does not just lean against it. It's pretty sturdy.
question:How is the ramp held on ?    answer: The entire thing is a piece oh {}#^. I gave up when the first piece I tried to assemble CRUMBLED as I used the Allen wrench. Return it!!!!!
question:How is the ramp held on ?    answer: With bolts..my cats do not use it at all.
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: I have four adult cats, ranging from 5 to 16lbs, who like to run all over this thing. They're pretty rough with it sometimes, and I do have to tighten the bolts periodically, but it's been very sturdy so far.
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: It is big enough for an adult cat. Mine is a Maine coon and he will be quite large when he is full grown. I love that he uses the scratching posts all the time.
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: It works for both. We got it for our 8 year old main coon and now 1 year old main coon kitten and they both use it regularly. If you have large cats, such as main coons, Siberians, or Norwegian forest cats the top two platforms are a little small, but for regular sized cats it would probably be just right
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: Our 3 year old cat weighing 13 lbs perches himself on the top tier all the time. It shakes only slightly but is very sturdy and stable.
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: This would be perfect for small cats, it wobbles when my 17# cat gets on and he doesn't hardly use it. We have plans to beef it up with a larger bottom and middle shelf hoping to gain some stability. Hope that helps.
question:Is this tree just for kittens or can an adult cat use it?    answer: All cats

question:Do the cats ever really use the hammock part?    answer: My cats don't use it but they are all adults; I suspect kittens might like it since most of them will try anything :). I use the hammock to store toys.

question:Can I please get the deminsions of the perches and the box? For V high base. Thank you.    answer: The top perch is 22"x11", lower perch is 22"x11" and the box is 15"x15"x15". This cat tree is the best I've ever seen and very affordable. Very well made, sturdy and the perches are covered with these amazing memory foam pads. I wash them in a lingerie bag on a gentle cycle and they come out looking like new. It had a very modern look to it - not a giant ugly carpet covered monster. Highly recommend by both me and my cat! see less
question:Can I please get the deminsions of the perches and the box? For V high base. Thank you.    answer: Estimating the top to be about 18 x 10, the lower one is an odd shape, maybe 10 inches across. We were disappointed with the furry patches that attach to the unit, so I cut carpets to fit and stapled them down. Now the cats like it a lot.
question:Is the rope made of sisal?    answer: As the others have said, the rope is made of seagrass. My cats like to scratch, and that loosened up the rope fairly quickly. If you catch it early, you can probably glue it back. You can also buy replacement posts on catit.com

question:Is the rope made of sisal?    answer: No, their website lists it as "sea grass", but in terms of texture it is very much like sisal. https://usa.hagen.com/Cats--are-demanding-creatures-and-so-are-cat-lovers

question:Can I buy replacement tubes    answer: Looking at this right now. I couldn't find any here on Amazon (quick search) but I found some on the catit.com website. Still need to check if they're the right match though.
question:Can I buy replacement tubes    answer: I really can't say, I just ordered , but what I can say is it's a nice cat tree and my daughter's cat love it, and it looks great put together with easy assembly. I hope this helps.

question:How tall is the v high base model? we are looking for a very tall cat tree.    answer: Around 4 feet
question:The reported dimensions in the descriptions seem completely off. What are the actual dimensions of the base?    answer: I was confused by the demensions also . But they are close. It’s because they are listing the demensions of each individual piece instead of the entire thing put together. The base is actually 22 x22 Once you put it together the little box for the cat to sleep in is 14 1/2 square . And the entire piece is 33” high . It is heavy and very sturdy . I have 5 cats and 3 if them use this constantly . The pad for them to sit in is very comfortable. They take turns sitting and looking out the window . My one cat ( who loves it and spends all night on it watching out the window ),is 18lbs . I am usually concerned about him knocking something over but this is amazing ! He jumps up and it doesn’t budge. He’s very rough and the only thing he has managed to take apart on it are the 2 little toys that were attached by string . He had them off within one day and now just chases them around the house. We have had this for about 3 months . It is also very attractive everyone comments on it . It is in our living room . I have been thinking of buying the larger one too now that I have seen how sturdy it is and just how well made it is in general . Also no carpet debris on the floor like normal scratchers . I’m fanatically clean so it’s perfect . see less

question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: I have a male Maine Coon who weighs 21 lbs. Actually, his weight only increased by a lb. or two after the first year. He's nine now, but still very active, and loves leaping up on the tree at top speed. It doesn't even wobble. The tree is so sturdy I'm sure it would work for a larger cat than mine. He's had 2 other trees, but he's always loved this one the best. He takes naps in the cradle and uses the round bed to view the world outside and talk to the birds. We've both been very pleased with it. see less
question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: Yes it will. We have 2 Maine Coons; one is 20#, one is 16#. They are both 2 so still growing slowly. There has been no issue tipping it. They love it for bird watching.
question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: Yes, it will. I have 6 cats, one of which is part Maine Coon and weighs 16+lbs. He lays on this all the time, and sometimes his 8lb "baby brother" lays on top of him while he is on it.
question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: Yes I have 2 Maine coons. One is 20 pounds.
question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: I selected this cat tree because the perches were the largest I could find on the market. I have a larger kitty and he loves it. Even the round space is big enough for him. The tower occasionally wobbles when we're playing with him with toys and he's riled up, but for chilling out it is quite stable. I found that placing a bit of weight on the bottom of the stand solved the problem. see less
question:Will this support the weight of a Maine Coon? He’s 19lbs now but he’s only 1 and has two more years of growing to do    answer: Yes
question:What is the dimensions of the house part?    answer: 17 cm long, 13 cm wide and 11 cm high
question:Is the condo really 6.6inches by 5inches? It can't possibly that small right? Or is that the hole size? I want the full condo size    answer: I think their dims are a little off...the condo itself is nice size. That is hole size. The ONLY downside to this is the top circular in my opinion. My cat is fine with it as she’s small (little over 5lbs) but this not for a bigger kitty or multiple cats in my opinion.
question:Is the condo really 6.6inches by 5inches? It can't possibly that small right? Or is that the hole size? I want the full condo size    answer: It’s not that small. My cats only use the top of the condo.

question:What are the dimensions of the condo?    answer: I don’t have that info. Should come with description. Very hard to assemble. I would not buy again.
question:My new rescue is kind of "fluffy." 15 lbs. Will she be able to fit inside the tube area and the box area?    answer: My cats each weigh 12 lbs. They are long hair but not fluffy. Each one has slept in the box area comfortably. Only one side of the box is firm...3 sides are fabric and stretch a little for comfort. Each cat also plays in the tube. Diameter of tube is 8 inches. Plus there is an opening in the top of the tube that is 6 inches in diameter. They poke their head out and sit like at a table! I hope this helps you make a decision. see less
question:My new rescue is kind of "fluffy." 15 lbs. Will she be able to fit inside the tube area and the box area?    answer: I would say your cat could fit just fine. My cat, Kira, is about 8-10 lbs and fits with lots of room to spare. It’s a sturdy cat tree. Kira hits it at a run and it doesn’t wobble or top. We do not have it secured to the wall. The top bed is soft with super soft edges. Took Kira a couple of weeks to get to the top. Now it is her favorite place to sleep or to grab my hair when I walk past. I would recommend this cat tree. Just be aware it is pretty big. see less
question:My new rescue is kind of "fluffy." 15 lbs. Will she be able to fit inside the tube area and the box area?    answer: Yes, mine is 16-17lbs and he fits fine. He prefers the top bed though cause he likes to spread out. So she will fit it just depends on how she like to lay down.

question:Is this good for large cats? … i have a mainecoon mix who’s about 22” or so long    answer: I don’t know if the one I got was just bad, but mine broke almost immediately and my cats are not very large, so I would probably go on the safe side and not get this one.
question:Is this good for large cats? … i have a mainecoon mix who’s about 22” or so long    answer: I would think it's a bit short to be all that fun for a very big cat. Also, the base is not that stable without some external reinforcement. It's not meant for heavy use.
question:Is this good for large cats? … i have a mainecoon mix who’s about 22” or so long    answer: Depends on its weight. Ours broke pretty quick. Avg sized house cat. (She still uses it) we had to reinforce the posts.
question:Is this good for large cats? … i have a mainecoon mix who’s about 22” or so long    answer: I bought 5 of them about 6 months ago. So far only one has broken where one of the flowers snapped in half and another the sisal came undone at the top. I have all of them placed in areas where they are against either a wall or the side of the sofa as they are just too lite to be free standing. Oddly my largest kitty weighing in at 17lbs loves curling up and sleeping in these and for her they have held up well. When these are ready to be retired unless the manufacturer reinforces them and improves the product stability I will most likely be trying some new alternatives. see less
question:Is this good for large cats? … i have a mainecoon mix who’s about 22” or so long    answer: No, not at all. It is more for a kitten…my small 6 lb cat doesn’t even like to sit on it. Poor quality also.
question:A lot of reviews make this product sound super tiny. Is it not big enough for a full grown slightly chonky kitty?    answer: It's a great product but it was smaller than I thought. My 11 wk old kitten (3 lbs now) can clamber to the bed on top with a little struggle and it's still roomy for him in the condo. I would think adult cats could fit but maybe not the really large breeds.
question:A lot of reviews make this product sound super tiny. Is it not big enough for a full grown slightly chonky kitty?    answer: It's big enough for my full grown slightly chonky kitty! He's between 14 and 16 lbs and curls up in the box part and on the top in the bed just fine! It's not a huge cat condo, but my cat likes it.

question:Can the top platform be on the left or right? The images show it on both sides.    answer: YES. YES. YES. I'm saying this 3 times because of the 3 answers ahead of me that say that it cannot be mounted on both sides. The directions default to left mounting, but you will easily see that if you turn the top panel of the base box 180 degrees before screwing it in place, the platform can mount right or left. I received this 7/2/2020 and it took me all of 10 mins to put together, very straightforward. There are photos among other people's reviews from 2019-2020 that also show they were able to mount left or right. see less

question:How large is the top? My cats are heavy. The one I have now top is 12 by 17 inches.    answer: 14 by 11.5" Only our small cat uses it. Our larger ones jumped up on it once and never again because it wobbled with their weight. I'm not thrilled with it for my big cats. It's a little lopsided with the pole coming out the edge of the box. The one positive is that it doesn't look much like a cat tree so it blends in nicely. see less
question:How large is the top? My cats are heavy. The one I have now top is 12 by 17 inches.    answer: The top is 13” by 14”. I have two large cats and they seem to have no issues with it. Either curl up or let parts hang over the sides! They love this cat tree!
