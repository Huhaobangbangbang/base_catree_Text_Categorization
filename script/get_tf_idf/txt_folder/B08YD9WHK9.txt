  I recommend this tree as a beginner tree for one or two small kittens, or a very calm and elderly cat. The package instructions say to stand it against a wall, which goes to show they know it\'s not very sturdy. The pillars seem to be plastic poles but in actuality they are just hollowed out tubes made of some thick cardboard with round plastic ends that are inserted to the tubes to link with the screws given. The tubes snap easy, my top pier did within 24 hours. The bottom platform rocks. I emailed them about replacing the top piece and I did not get a reply back. My one-year-old cat who is very excitable football tackled the whole tree to the ground and she\'s not very big.
  This was a gift for my mother in law and her cats. I assembled it for her and her two cats immediately fell in love with it. She has a small adult cat and a very very large adult cat and they both were able to get on top at the same time. This was placed at the center of her room but hope to put it near a wall preferably near a corner where it can hug two walls just for safety and more stability. The quality of the product is ok but that is what we get for this good price. It is made from particle wood so it does seem fragile. For now it works and hope that it can last years. It makes the cats happy and therefor my mother in law as well. Thanks :-)
  It\'s garbage as I initially said when I got it. 1st platform started cracking.. The wood is very flimsy &amp; cheap..what else would you expect out of China.
  Once I got it built the cat tree was nice. Kind of small, but works good. The assembly was AWFUL! And I mean awful! No worded directions, just pictures and it was confusing. I mean, I don\'t know how to build stuff! My husband, who works at a hardware store and puts stuff together all the time was somewhat confused by the directions as well. That really is my only complaint which is why I gave it 3 stars overall
  I love it and can&#8217;t wait to bring my kitty home to see how much he will love it! I will admit it was a tad hard to put together but if your patient you&#8217;ll get it! Also don&#8217;t understand why people keep saying it&#8217;s slept sturdy. If you tighten the screws down it&#8217;s very sturdy! You&#8217;ll just need to put it against the wall if you have a bigger cat so they can&#8217;t knock it down.
  Perfect height, not to spendy, it&#8217;s a decent price for what you are paying, there&#8217;s instructions, the items are labeled on the instructions but the items themselves are not labeled. So assembly took about 20 minutes after matching pieces to the letters on the instructions. It&#8217;s perfect size for a small-medium size cat and doesn&#8217;t take up to much room while being a medium size cat tree.
  Well it\'s very nice, great price, and easy to assemble if you have a cat say under 10lbs...our big 13lber couldn\'t fit in the bottom hammock, or the house and barely fit on the top circle so I think this needs renamed as a kitten or small feline house..
  This product is pretty much worthless as none of my cats can fit on any part of it. These companies need to specify for kittens or small cats or if it fits large cats. Ridiculous!
  Fairly easy to assemble, instructions didn&#8217;t seem very clear but also I don&#8217;t assemble things much in the first place lol Good size for kittens and medium size cats, don&#8217;t recommend for larger cats. Gets the job done and keeps kitty off the counters
  Easy to assemble, not by the directions though. The directions for it are ridiculous.
