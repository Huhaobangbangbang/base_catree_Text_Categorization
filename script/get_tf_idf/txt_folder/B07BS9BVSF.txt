  I don\'t know how I feel about this product... I mean Chloe Rose loves it, but now she doesn\'t want to lounge on me to get a quick nap. I\'m feeling kind of abandoned...Best-worst thing ever! (Sniff)
  I told myself that I would never buy a cat tower that I had to put together.  But I was reading the reviews on this one and everyone was saying how easy it was to put together, so I bit the bullet and ordered it.  I am so glad that I did!  It only took me about half an hour to put it together!  As I was finishing it up, I was thinking to myself, "Watch, these cats won\'t show any interest in it now that I\'ve put  in all this work into it!" (everyone who has cats knows what a perverse sense of humor they can have!)  Literally 5 seconds after I had finished the tower and put it into place, all three of my cats were on it and having a ball!  They love the dangling jingle ball and rope!  As I\'m writing this review right now, I hear jingling bells in the background!  If you are thinking about getting a cat tower, you will love this one!  It is six feet tall and very sturdy when put together.  I will definitely get another one of these if I need another cat tower!
  I really love this cat tree and so does my cat! I was a little worried about buying this cat tree online because you can\'t tell how big (or small) they are. Some of these trees seem to be made for kittens. But this tree is actually very big and has lots of space for a full grown cat! There isn\'t any of the shelves, tubes or beds that she doesn\'t fit. My cat is not huge but for a one year old cat she is bigger than most of my friends cats! She has lots of space even in the little box, which she loves! (See attached pictures of her lounging in it!)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> - It is sturdy and doesn\'t seem like it would ever tip over from playing or pulling on it.<br/> - It is about 5 feet tall from the floor to the top of the bed on top.<br/> - It is really soft<br/> - It looks nice<br/> - It was really easy to put together and comes with everything you need<br/> - It even comes with an anchor strap for attaching it to the wall<br/> - Big, spacious areas for cat to play<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> - I\'ve only found one, which is the two upper shelves are almost the same size so it is hard for my cat to get from one shelf to the other. She almost feel the first time she tried to climb up. But she\'s found other ways to get up.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this was a great buy and recommend it to other cat lovers! So I rated it 5 stars!
  This was a great buy. Very easy to assemble and is very sturdy. We only have one cat but seems to be sturdy enough for several. It also comes with a strap to mount to wall for extra balance if you wish to use, we didn\'t think it was necessary but it is there if you need it. Don\'t hesitate on puchasing this cat tree.
  I&#8217;m in love with this cat tower. I spent hours upon hours researching the best tower at the best price. We knew we needed a high tower so our kitten could escape our dogs and young kids but we also knew this tower would be in our living room and would need to look nice. After 2 weeks of use, I&#8217;m very very very happy with this purchase. However soft you think it looks, double it- I could sleep on this if they made it large enough!<br/><br/>Nothing in this world is so perfect it couldn&#8217;t use improvement, this tower is no different. There is a bell toy that hangs from the bed that our kitty loves. The first day we put it together (I did it by myself and it only took about an hour) our kitty got her claw stuck in the bell and began screaming. I got her free and thought it was a fluke. 3 days later the same thing happened so we decided to remove the toy all together just to be safe.<br/><br/>Even with the bad toy choice, we really are happy with this tower I will recommend it to all of my friends and buy another one if we ever get more than one kitty. I am writing this review of my own free will. I did not receive a discount or special offer for a positive review. I simply really love having something this cool in our home!
  This tree is pretty big. I&#8217;m 5&#8217;3&#8221; and the to bed is above my eye level.<br/>Our 16 month old cat, Kira, loves this cat tree. She got the ball off of it pretty quickly.<br/>Loves playing with the rope and scratching on the rope wrapped posts. Took her about a week to get to the top bed, now that is her favorite place to sleep. She just started using the cylinder and the opening above it the past few days. Wants nothing to do with the hammock. It is sturdy. She hits this at a fun and it does not wobble or top. She is not a big cat, probably 8 lbs.<br/>I would recommend this cat tree and I would buy it again.
  I was so excited when I saw the tree and felt how soft it was. Tree is for my niece and nephew furbabies and I wanted it to be fantastic for them. Started putting it together and all was going well. Until we got to the middle shelf with box and hole cutout. Carpet was glued to the wrong side of the board. Or straight up holes drilled in the wrong place to start with. This made the box attachment holes not aline up. Fixable with a drill to make a new attachment hole. But, fustrating to buy a product at a great price and then have issues with craftsmanship. Looks to be a great product otherwise. Just be ready to alter assembly instructions.
  Initial Review:<br/>My cat and I were really excited to received and put his new cat tree together today. We were almost done with assembling the pieces, when I came across the sisal post that goes at the very top connecting the top plush bed to the rest of the cat tree, and found the bolt that was supposed to be attached to one end of it just randomly laying at the bottom of the box/package. The plastic on the end that the bolt was supposed to be securely screwed into was completely torn. Needless to say, our installation came to a half and my cat&#8217;s cat tree is not finished. We are so sad.<br/>I&#8217;m kind of relieved because who knew how stable that bolt was inside the sisal post. To think that it could have broken while my cat is perched up on the top bed. I can&#8217;t even imagine my cat falling off out of nowhere because of a defect in the sisal post and bolt.<br/>I sent an email to the company hoping that maybe they can just send a replacement part for the broken part I received. I&#8217;d hate to have to disassemble it all and I know my cat would hate to see, what was supposed to be his cat tree, sent back.<br/><br/>If you purchase this, I highly advise to inspect all pieces and parts before putting it together for the safety of your cats.<br/><br/>Updated Review:<br/>After contacting the seller, they have been really responsive in sending me a replacement of the broken part. I received the new piece wrapped securely and was shipped all the way from China! It took over a week to receive the item, but that\'s because of the international shipping. I right away installed the top bed to the pole and my cat couldn\'t be happier! Thank you, Bewishome for being awesome sellers!
  Wow, first of all, it came in a very timely manner,<br/><br/>2) wasn&#8217;t THAT difficult to put together, only real &#8220;difficult&#8221; part was finding the holes sometimes only because of the fabric, (no biggie though because you don&#8217;t want to see that infection it&#8217;s all put together anyways just takes some time finding them to set it up)<br/><br/>3)it seems to be extremely sturdy! It even has a strap on the back so you have the option to stabilize it to a wall if you feel the need to. I however have not done that and it&#8217;s not moved a bit! And my babies are all pretty big!<br/><br/>4) we&#8217;ve never lived in a place big enough to be able to give our babies their own area, or cat tower, and sooo GLAD we can now!! They&#8217;ve been kind of uncertain about it until two of my babies figured out a couple of spots, our BIG white cat weighs approximately 15 pounds, his spot is the hammock<br/>Our little Persian, she&#8217;s always looking for a dark, hidden place, so when I showed her the condo, that was IT! She stays in there pretty much all jc the time now! She has REALLY come out if her shell!!<br/><br/>My MAIN purpose was obviously for my babies to have their own area, but, also toTRY to save my furniture and curtains lol, they are constantly sharpening their claws on my couch &#128545; I&#8217;ve noticed that is slowing up a bit!! I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this!! I totally WISH I could afford another one, OR add on to it going outward to Mae a larger area for them!! Hopefully one day I can!! Thank you so VERY MUCH!!
  Built it with a cat insistent on &#8220;helping&#8221;.  It took about 2 hours due to fuzzy interference.<br/>The carpet is very thin. After having it for 2 months, my cats have already stripped the carpet from some of the pillars.  (And I clip their nails regularly).<br/>The top shelf is wobbly and unstable.  The twine is a very thin cord size.<br/><br/>They skimped on materials.  Given the choice, I would have chose a different cat tree and spent more money on one.
  I have two kittens that are just under 1 year old. They LOVE this cat tree. I\'m not a very handy person, but was able to easily put this together. Just a warning the instructions came in a different language, but every step had a picture to show what needed to be done.<br/><br/>The cloth material is VERY soft and my kittens absolutely love the feel of it and sometimes prefer sitting on it instead of with me!!!  I thought they were going to like the hanging hammock, but they really want nothing to do with it other than bite at the rope that holds it. oh well!  This is a plush cat tree and with all the ins and outs, they play on it most of the day.<br/><br/>I gave this 5 stars because it really is absolutely amazing, but there are a couple downfalls:<br/><br/>1.  The blue cloth does "shed" a bit all around the floor. It may be from my cats scratching at it or just normal wear and tear. I don\'t mind too much, but for some people, it may be really annoying.<br/>2. When being used by active cats, it did wobble a little bit. My cats are just under 5 pounds and 7 pounds. They would push themselves off it or wrestle on it and it would shake a bit. I ended up putting a 10 pound weight on the bottom just to make sure everything was safe and secure.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is an amazing product and i have very, very happy kittens!
  I bought this cat tree for my older cat because, in my new apartment, I don\'t have any easily accessible places for my cat to be able to climb easily. Plus, it had a lot of features that I thought my cat would really enjoy. This tree assembled very easily, and I did not have any problems with the instructions. The majority of my apartment is carpeted, and I did notice that this tree did get a little wobbly since it wasn\'t sitting on a solid surface. That is not really the fault of this tree though and more of a downside of my carpeted floors. I fixed this issue by getting some corner braces from the hardware store for about $5 and using them to secure the tree to the wall. After I did that, the tree got much more stable. It took maybe a week or so before my cat finally started getting up on this tree on her own. I think it just took some time for her to adjust to it being there and to realize that it was for her. She seems to really enjoy it now, especially the little enclosed area. I don\'t really see her getting much use out of the hammock and I think the tunnel was probably designed for smaller cats and kittens, but I figured that would be the case when I purchased this tree and I was really more concerned with making it easier for my cat to get some elevation in her new living space. The only complaint that I have about this product is the bed at the very top of the tree. I thought my cat would really enjoy this because it feels super soft and comfortable and it provides extra height that would allow my cat to get on top of my bookcase if she wanted to, but since it is only supported on the top of one little pillar, it does wobble a significant amount when my cat tried to jump up to it. Since it is farther away from the wall than the back side of the tree, it makes it difficult to secure that to the wall like I secured the rest of the tree. So, until I find a solution to that problem, my cat will probably not utilize that feature. I think it would be improved if there was another column to support the bed; it probably would not look as nice, but I think stability takes a higher priority in this case. Overall, I think that this tree is a very nice looking cat tree compared to many of the others I saw, it was very easy to assemble, and it is a pretty solid cat tree with lots of nice features for cats to enjoy. Would recommend.
  I can happily say my kitty-cat loves this tree/tower!! It\'s very sturdy wood, easy setup, looks nice, soft top pillow/bed, twisted rope leading down to the strong tunnel, nice size bedroom, stretchy string with a ball &amp; bell, lower hammock (my kitty has never showed interest in) &amp; all the scratching posts are tuff &amp; tight. Silly kitty didn\'t know how or what they were!! It was the cutest thing when she discovered it was for her claws to knead on! For 2 weeks my husband &amp; I would scratch \'em to get her to knead. I even tried running her paws down \'em too but she wouldn\'t tract her claws. The looks we would receive was hilarious to say the least. It\'s a good price for the happiness it has brought into our lives. I recommend this 100%.
  I bought this in January 8, 2022 for my 2 cats. one a kitten one a small adult.  The flat part above the little boxed in area has zero support on the sides and only the two posts that are directly under the very top cat cushion bed... it is now February 7th 2022.. The whole top of the tower is now leaning and crushing the boxed in area with the weight of the cats as she will lay there and bat at the little ball hangind down. This is a design flaw in my opinion as we have to figure out how to put a board or a post of some type INSIDE the "Cave" to keep the upper floor from collapsing and toppling the whole thing over. I am actually quite diappointed in the fact it has only been a month and this issue is arising .. I would say PASS on this one and go to something more sturdy ..
  This thing is big! However the features themselves such as the tube, cat house, hammock and top platform are a little small. Our adult cat is average size and is pretty cramped in all the features. The tube is particularly small. It\'s a little wobbly on the very top when he\'s on it. He always slept in the top of his old cat tree but haven\'t seen him do that with this one, probably because it is too small for him to comfortably lie down. But he does squeeze into the house. He doesn\'t fit in the hammock at all. This would be great for kittens.
  Cats freaking loved it from the moment I opened the box! I\'ve even got new holes on my for proof.. my girls helped me every step of the way! Except when I had to litterly dump one out of the square box&#129315; instructions are pictures,and I have alot of extra screws (I didn\'t put on the tunnel due to fat cats and they won\'t use it at all on the tree).. they wrestled on it not long after I finished and both fell off,and it staid up!! They found a new place to enjoy,so I\'m happy.<br/><br/>I\'m not able to upload the pictures, like AT ALL, for this product.
  Everything went together easily with the supplied tools.<br/>- Setup time was about 30 minutes.<br/>- Accommodates one larger cat on the second level tier and a smaller cat on the upper perch.<br/>- My younger cat loves the tube and hangs upside down while I play catch with him.<br/>- Offers a four-point steady base and is very solid without wobble.<br/>- Includes a nylon attachment point and hardware for customers wishing to secure the stand to a wall.<br/><br/>One CON&gt;<br/>- One hole was not drilled to secure the middle cat box to the middle-upper tier.  Really did not need it since the box is secured by three other bolts at the bottom.
  Kittens love it! Cats love it!  You won\'t be disappointed!  I did have to adjust the height of the hammock in order to keep it off the bottom level, but that was easy enough.  The large flat piece on the upper level is probably its best feature, especially if you have larger cats.
  Both our kittens love it and it seems this tower will be able to hold them as they grow. The only thing is the square-ish enclosure part had holes drilled for an upside down installation and some mysterious parts of the fluffy cover material came off (but we can&#8217;t see from where). Other than that the light grey is the right color, the size is right and variety of features keeps them interested. The top perch platform seems to be the little one&#8217;s favorite hang out spot since she&#8217;s vertically challenged.
  Absolutely the best decision I&#8217;ve made! I have 4 cats and they&#8217;ve never had a proper cat tower, so when I was looking for one I found this one and saw it as the best deal for what I needed. The instructions are simple, the pieces fit together nicely and as long as you screw the pieces on nice and tight it doesn&#8217;t wobble around. Make sure the top little bed part is on the tightest because I know a few reviews say that it breaks off but my 15lb cat fits on it relatively fine. The little house is a perfect napping spot and my little kitten loves laying in the tunnel and swatting at the rope through the hole. Even while I was putting it together they were laying on the parts! A little bit of catnip and they easily got used to it, and lounge and play on it all day. I&#8217;d suggest putting it next to a window for the best results, because it&#8217;ll keep them off other windows and counters for the most part. I&#8217;ve had it for a while and it seems to be holding up pretty good, but there&#8217;s always that rare chance that some of the parts might be broken, so just make sure you inspect the screws, holes and seams of the fabric just to make sure it all checks out. But it&#8217;s been a real life changing buy for my cats ever since I got it!
  My human servant made a good selection with this one. After my last tree broke (she will try to blame me but we all know she was just jealous) I had no where to sit high above my humans and judge them. This tree is much better. It is super sturdy and doesn\'t shift as I jump from the 2nd floor onto it in a death defying leap!! My human thinks the hammock is fool proof with these clips, but rest assure I will figure out a way to get it off. The plush bed at the top is the best for me to rub my head against before yeowling at the top of my lungs. And don\'t forget the bell and ball!! It was made to annoy the humans.<br/>I think I might puke in her shoes later tonight to show my affection.
  My cat was crawling up the curtains, so I started looking for a condo for him. I shopped for about an hr. When I saw one I liked I put it my shopping cart. Then I saw i liked this cat condo in my cart twice, well that\'s how I ended up buying this one. Its sturdy built n NOT one hole was off a centimeter. I emailed the company to tell them how much I liked it. The instructions do come w it. Some other people were saying they didn\'t receive the instructions. I\'m glad I bought this for my furbaby.
  Overall: We have two super energetic kitties and they absolutely love it! They like running around the floor day and night, but after when they got this tower they spend so much time playing and resting on it. We&#8217;re even sad that they won&#8217;t spend much time with us on the couch anymore! Lol<br/>Sturdiness: Looks sturdy enough with two kitties chasing each other up and down.<br/>Assembly: Although my arms hurt for couple days after assembling it, I think it was simple enough for one woman to put it together.<br/>Cons: -1 star because the pieces of fabric started to fall on the floor in couple days.

  I bought this doohickey for our new baby, Oreo. I should have done it a long time ago. I had a cat that I loved very much. She was the best little cat. Petite, she never bothered anyone. She liked sleeping in our carport in a lawn chair and one day a husky and pit came into our carport and ripped her apart. There was nothing we could do &#128542;. She was such a good baby. About a month or so later Oreo showed up outtano where. We let the GrandPrincess name him. I bought the doohickey. I\'m hoping it will save his life!!
  This is a really nice cat tree for the price. The covered platforms are "fur" covered, rather than carpeting, and it is not as dense as one would hope, so it sits kind of flat, but R2 and D2 like it and haven\'t complained yet and this is nice and high so it gives them some climbing exercises that they don\'t get much of as indoor cats who were once ferals. Even R2 got up on it and she is very finicky. Think she is just trying to stake out some territory for herself before D2 claims it all. All in all, very happy with purchase and had no issues.
  I love having this for my 2 cats, mom an daughter. They each have their own favorite spots. As I know they don\'t mind it, I however had a horrible time figuring out the instructions. They don\'t label anything and you would think it would be pretty straight forward. It was difficult and yes usually I never have any issues putting something together but this was like Ikea stuff. Definitely worth the pain and time though. I do have to keep tightening 2 of the upper sections also.
  I took my time assembling this, and I think that\'s what saved me. The old woodworkers\' adage about measuring twice to ensure you only need to cut once saved me several times as I almost used the wrong post or hardware. I used the directions to double-checked myself several times throughout the process.. I used several plastic containers to separate the hardware and made a separate pile for each type of post. It wasn\'t difficult to assemble and only took me about 30 minutes. Everything was well packaged upon arrival, especially the hardware that was wrapped in plastic and taped all around. (Definitely have something to catch all the hardware as you unwrap it.)<br/><br/>My kitten loves running up and down it and no longer scratches the furniture because he loves attacking the posts so much. He loves the different activity spaces and all the different ledges, especially the top one so he can look down on me and my dog. I like to hide his toys in random places in the tower so that he has to hunt them so that he\'s engaged while also getting some exercise. The tower is very study, safe, and long-lasting.
  It has been a year since we had this delivered. For the prize we are happy it has lasted this long, it has definitely survived 2 active cats using it everyday, however, it would have been nice if instead of the soft fuzzy fabric that has as a cover it had come with actual carpet material so that the cats could climb verstically instead of just jumping from level to level. That is why the 4 stars instead of 5.<br/><br/>But for the price we paid, it is a good deal
  2/3 cats used it pretty quickly, though that\'s more of cats personal preference than anything the company did. But 0/3 cats use the cubby hole, tube, nor hammock (though they like boxes and cat tunnels so that wasn\'t a consistent indicator) So if you\'re willing to spend the money for a little something extra, stick to the plain platforms and scratch areas unless you know they\'ll use such features. It\'s really sad to spend an extra 30-40.bucks and only see them use the very top 2 platforms. :( I\'d stick to this brand, but wish I\'d gotten a simpler tree.
  I\'ve had this product barely past the return window.<br/>The top piece fell off with my cat on it! He fell off and landed on the floor, very angrily.<br/>This was assembled correctly, but the wood was simply not strong enough to hold my cat.<br/>My cat is rather small, but this wood was still too soft.<br/>This was an inexpensive product... But I\'m rather upset that his favorite spot fell off today...<br/>I\'ll be contacting the seller so they know about this design issue.<br/>Picture with cat on top is from when I initially installed.<br/>Lastly, the parts were pretty hard to tell apart, but aside from the manual, this tree installed nicely.
  I like the tree ok for my two adult cats. My problem is that they have a difficult time figuring out how to go up and down it. Especially, when on the top they tend to jump from so high up, I&#8217;m afraid they are going to hurt themselves. They aren&#8217;t young cats by any means and not very small either. The house or &#8220;square&#8221; could definitely be larger. They don&#8217;t use the tunnel at all. And never use the hammock because it just touches the ground if they were to anyways. Unfortunately, we switched from a different tree and are not as satisfied this time around. But who knows it may be just right for your cat.
  Luckily it was still able to be assembled but 3 holes were drilled in the wrong spot, the condo had to be installed upside down to make up for it and the hole to balance the top platform over the condo didn\'t line up at all so I\'m worried about the stability of the bed on top of that platform. My cat loves it though. He\'s 16lbs and it supports him great. Since it was still able to be assembled I don\'t want to bother exchanging or sending it back but I\'m still dissapointed and frustrated. I just hope it doesn\'t cause problems.
  &#160;My cat wouldn&#8217;t touch this tree for 3-4 days. Then my kids started giving him attention, and suddenly he&#8217;s exploring on his own. The carpet is softer than expected and it&#8217;s fairly sturdy (haven&#8217;t yet wall mounted it). It&#8217;s narrow so I&#8217;m not sure how a big cat would maneuver it- especially getting down unless in a single jump. But plenty of places to scratch and hide, so I&#8217;m happy with purchase.
  We bought our first cat tower in March. It&#8217;s held up REALLY WELL! We have 3 cats. 2, 4 month old , 5 lb kittens and their momma @ 7 lbs.  We wanted a second one so after a bunch of shopping came back to this one and bought it again! But it&#8217;s been up only a week and within a couple days the ball&amp; string fell off and the rope completely came out of the housing yesterday. I&#8217;ve tried to placate contact seller directly  but to no avail. I&#8217;m kinda disappointed in this one &#128533;
  I bought this for my 13-pound tabby cat and he is very happy about it! Loves climbing up there to lord over the dog from the many perches and cubbyholes.<br/>Assembly only took about a half hour, and the provided instructions were really easy to follow. Screw a piece in there, twist the posts into place, and, voila, your cat tree is complete.<br/><br/>My only note is that the base of the tree could be heavier for stability&#8217;s sake, but I feel that can be pretty easily addressed by throwing a couple of weights onto it. They provide a little screw to anchor the tree to the wall, too, but if you&#8217;d rather not punch a hole in your wall and be able to move it around your house at will, I think finding some cat-friendly weights are the best bet.
  The fur on this item is of such poor quality that it ripped when my cat tried to scratch one of the posts. The "cave" is only fur so now that has holes in it too. This is not worth the money I paid for it. I do like the styling of it and the size but would not recommend this to anyone.
  I like that there is enough room for both of my cats. One cat likes to climb high, the other prefers the cubby. Now she likes to drop her toys into the hole and scoot them out of the tube. It was very easy to assemble, comes with everything you need. The only thing i wish was different is for it to be more padded, it is like a fabric on a hard surface, but it\'s not bad. The cats like it and I\'m happy with it. *Update - I think I like this fabric better, seems not to collect hair as much and easy to clean.<br/>I have two female cats, one is skinny, one is chunky. The chunky one fits in the cubby. If it was a male cat that was really big, they might not fit, but the walls are stretchy fabric. I don\'t think either cat has went in the tube, the skinny one might be able to, they just like to play with getting toys into or out of it. They haven\'t tried the hammock yet, I think I\'ll tighten it a little, they might try it.
  I have 24 indoor only rescue cats. We just recently lost our home in a flood and we lost everything but each other. Buying my cats two of these towers was one of the first things I did. We are limited on space, as we are in a temp home, otherwise I would have bought more. If we ever find a new home, they&#8217;ll have several again!!<br/><br/>Just having something familiar helped relieve some of their stress, and mine.<br/><br/>These towers are sturdy and easy to assemble. They are easy to clean and surprisingly, the rope stays on pretty good.<br/><br/>The only problem they have is deciding who gets the hammock!
  I only have one pretty large cat, so I downgraded from my Go Pet Club three-perch, two-enclosure, two-ramp tree to this one as I figured that the previous one was overkill.  My previous tree always often required maintenance (retightening screws and brackets) and the perches were completely unpadded.  My cat loves it and uses more elements of this tree more than he did in my Go Pet Club model.  He only used to use one of the perches and very rarely used any of the enclosures.  Now he loves his new padded perch, loves the enclosure, and the open surface on the top level is also nice for him to sprawl out on.  The material is also much softer.  Easy assembly as well.
  My wife and I must&#8217;ve bookmarked over a dozen cat trees and read dozens of owner reviews trying to find an acceptable tree that both the cats and we would love. We are very happy with this tree!<br/>Great fabric, durable (so far after 3 months), the scratch posts are still in excellent condition, they enjoy and use each part of the tree. Both my cats are adult and above average size (not weight) and they fit in the top perch perfectly. I usually come downstairs in the morning to find them both sleeping or looking outside together. The brown fabric doesn&#8217;t look ugly and matches our living room fine.
  Extremely poor staples on the top tier I didn\'t even notice until I saw a cut on my cat\'s face from it at least 4 of the Staples at the base of the top pillar were not made correctly so I\'m going to have to figure out a way to solve it and likely have to bring my cat to the vet because of this.
  I was concerned at the height of this for my young cat, but after putting it together (which was fast and easy-about 20 minutes total) I realized that it is very sturdy and solid. It is larger than I expected so thats a challenge, but overall this is a great tower for the king of the house. He loves it!<br/>The only thing I would recommend is not to install the rope toy. I found pieces of it that my cat had chewed off and I didn&#8217;t want him swallowing it so I removed it.<br/>Highly recommended and I know you&#8217;re cat will love it too!
  Our Belsnickel absolutely LOVES this! We shopped locals first, but they couldn\'t beat this design, and their cheapest price was $25 more than this one. This cat is absolutely nuts about it! If she\'s not running around and jumping around on it, like an absolute maniac, she\'s enjoying her perch at the top, for a nap, overseeing her kingdom. We\'ve spent much time, sitting together, and laughing hysterically, as she enjoys this. MONEY WELL SPENT! The material is very soft and fluffy, not like the carpet texture we were expecting. If I have any concerns, it\'s whether or not the top perch will last long, once she reaches 10+ pounds. Perhaps a wider base for the perch. And we purchased this model because it was the closest to all the features we wanted, but still, we couldn\'t find a model with an angled, scratching board, where the hammock is. She\'s not a fan of the hammock, and if we could purchase and install a separate, angled scratching board, in place of the hammock, we certainly would. Even if it was a special order. All in all, would definitely buy again, especially a model with a scratching board and not just posts.
  While this was fairly easy to assemble and the cats loved to play on it, the top part broke while my cat was sitting on it in the middle of the night. We have only had this for about 6/7 months too. He only weighs about 9 lbs so you wouldn\'t imagine that would be an issue. Luckily, he was not hurt when this happened. I have submitted a video of the incident as it was caught on our security cameras. The cats seriously loved this thing though, so we are sad to see it break. The top part took the bolt with it so it is unable to be fixed. Disappointed.
  Overall, great purchase. I got this for my sister who has two bengals. They&#8217;re lanky and about average size, maybe even small in my opinion, as far as cats go and the male seems to dislike the tube. The other reviews mentioned their cats having a hard time fitting in it and I can definitely see why lol that and the fact that the hammock is on the bottom.. they aren&#8217;t really comfortable with that. And then the box house on the middle tier has a gap between that and the top level - which is also weird. The cats try to wedge themselves in there, but can&#8217;t, so it has left us wondering why the manufacturer didn&#8217;t just make the box house taller and meet the bottom of the top level.<br/><br/>All in all though, the cats really like it, it&#8217;s a &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; kinda size (not too small, not too big), and the blue-grey color is even prettier than I&#8217;d imagined.
  Easy to assemble, feels more solid than some I\'ve seen, the plushy material covering is a bit slippery and being up against hard particle board, the kittens slip off occasionally.  I would say maybe a thin layer of something under the material would pad it and make it better grip for cat claws, other than that, good value.
  My cat would not go near this  thing before she reached 8-9 months old, now she loves it. She goes like a lightning bolt across the room up the couch and up the car tree. I put it on a 2 foot tall end table now the top bed is about 18 inches from the ceiling and cats love to observe from above. Update 10/25/19 Cat still loves it but accessories are wearing out, the hanging rope is completely frayed and she ripped the hanging ball off. Would be nice if the accessories could be replaced.
  &#160;It&#8217;s super cute and exactly like the picture but the very top piece is not super sturdy. It&#8217;s very easy to assemble. My cat is 13 lbs and about 18 inches in length (not counting her tail) she&#8217;s able to sleep on the top platform comfortably :) however my cat can barely fit in the small little &#8216;room&#8217; and also the tunnel&#8230;my cat&#8217;s a little overweight but if you have a smaller cat it&#8217;ll be perfect for them.
  Highly recommend. Great price for the product. I had no issues putting it together and I hadn&#8217;t even had the first part of the instructions done and my kitty was already wanting to play on it. She patiently waited and played till I had it done and then she didn&#8217;t want to get off of it. I really like that they offer so many colors too so you can match it with your home decor.
  It looks good and with two kittens it has everything in one place a hammock, tunnel, multi levels with toys along the way, a house when they want and two levels on sunning as t sits by one of my front windows. Lots of scratching posts too! All for a very reasonable price. Word to the wise make sure you tighten all of the fittings Very tight...tighten, take a break then tighten again!
