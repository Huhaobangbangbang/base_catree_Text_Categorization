  This cat tree is SO adorable and very soft in person - the only problem is that my cat is WAY too big for it. It\'s much shorter and smaller than the photos make it seem. Ideal for a kitten/young adult cat, but my two year old ragdoll is way too big for it and I will be (sadly) returning it.
  The bottom piece is actually two separate pieces that is only held together by the carpet. There was a washer that seemed to be an extra part as it wasn&#8217;t shown on the instructions but I realized it was meant to support the bottom two pieces to keep from folding. Unfortunately, the bottom piece  is not strong enough to hold back the two pieces with just the washer and it pulled the material in half. I was able to reinforce the bottom with some boards I had but for the price, I expect much better quality. The second picture depicts how the tower ends up when my cat jumps off.
  UPDATE: The company reached out to me, concerned that the product I received had broken so easily and was unsafe for my cats. They promptly sent a replacement that had some helpful design changes. The replacement cat tree is far more stable and no longer wobbles all over the place when my cats jump up on it. So far the little flower perches have held up this time and my cats are throughly pleased to have their bedroom cat napping spot restored.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this cat tree. My cats wanted to love this cat tree. You see, they were several months overdue for new Kitty trees and toys so I ordered them a flurry of goodies here on Amazon, including this cat tree.<br/><br/>We had high hopes. However due to the way this cat tree is constructed (the bottom piece folds in half, held together only by the carpet and a bolt inconveniently placed at the center of the two pieces) it wobbles and sways more than a drunk person at a frat party.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the smaller yellow flower ledge also snapped in half when one of my cats jumped up on it. His name is Fred, he is very conscious about his figure so imagine his dismay when he jumped up and the ledge holding him snapped in half. Needless to say it didn&#8217;t do much for his self esteem.<br/><br/>If I had time I would return this product. But alas, it&#8217;s the holiday season and I think I may be several days past the return window now. That said, be aware that this product is clearly not worth the asking price, I&#8217;ve seen better engineering from five year olds with legos.<br/><br/>Now, thanks to the failure of this cat tree to deliver a fun, sturdy perching/playing/napping option for my mini lions, my wife and our army of cats have convinced me that I must instead build new cat trees from scratch.
  Amazing and so cute! A little short, but fits perfectly in a corner or right next to the bed. My cats love it! My chunkier cat in the photo barely fits, but still loves to lay and sleep in it! I highly recommend!
  It is so cute but honestly the quality is trash. Our cats ( 3 ) tour this thing up faster then they do plastic bags. I mean, we have had a cat tree for 6 months and literally no damage even though they use it all the time, but this right here. Man, the bottom is made of cardboard, literally not figuratively.  I will probably transfer the posts to a piece of wood but that&#8217;s not what I paid for the item to do. I wouldn&#8217;t by unless you have a slow lazy cat that just sits, ours are young and do the most so that probably why it broke. We did have to add a planner ring to the bottom to make it work but it basically trashed.
  Let\'s start with the positives. It looks like it will be sturdy enough once we can get it assembled. The colors are vibrant. And the platforms definitely look like they will be comfortable for the cats. It comes with everything you need except detailed instructions? It has been extremely difficult just to screw the parts together. A piece was included in the Box that was not depicted on the instructions (an extra pedestal or possibly an extension to one of the pedestals?) And its use was not explained in the instructions. And not to sound Petty but it also smells weird like vinegar. Luckily my dad is good with tools so we\'ll see if we can try and get it together anyway.
  It is adorable but in no way stable. The base is in two pieces, held together by a piece of carpet. I ended up having to use gorilla glue to hold them together because it would rock and almost fall over when my cats jumped on it. Even after gluing the base together, the top platform is still very unstable. It leans to whichever side the cat is sitting, which means my cats rarely get on it.  You can see the lean in the attached picture (cat lured to perch with catnip).
  This is the cutest cat tower I\'ve ever seen! It\'s so much more colorful than most other cat towers, and has such a pretty, unique design. I\'d buy it even if I didn\'t have cats &#8212; it\'s that cute.<br/><br/>It was easy to assemble. It\'s on the shorter side when it comes to towers, but it\'s perfect for kittens. I can see my kitties outgrowing the perches as they grow bigger, but since it\'s not too tall, I hope they\'ll continue to use it when they\'re older and can\'t climb as high as they used to.
  My all cats love this tree. Will buy more !
  &#160;I was looking for something cute to go in my daughter&#8216;s room for the kitten. It is held together by a split piece of cardboard the cat is afraid to go on it because it is so unstable as shown by the video. We missed our return window so we&#8217;re stuck with this flimsy thing.
  Great little cat tree, super stinkin cute. Cat wouldn\'t stay on it for the photo, even with cat nip!
  Most cat trees are too tall, or too wide, and definitely too ugly. :-) This one was not only super-cute, but also, we could mix and match the pieces to make it exactly fit. AAA+++
  Love this cat tree,tried buying it from Wish twice and they said it wasn\'t available after days of ordering it.This seller shipped super fast &#128578;very good quality cat tree.Thank you!
  My 10 lb cat enjoyed this cat tree for a couple of weeks. He played with the ball. He scratched the post. And I love the look of it. But, alas, he just went to get in it and bam. Over it fell with the bottom cracked. I\'m returning it and this time going for sturdy over cute.
  This was a great purchase for my kitty! I love that it is cuter than the typical cat tree and goes with my decor much better. It was really easy to assemble and is very soft. Good quality and well worth the price. Quick shipping. Thank you!
  It\'s been less than a year since I purchased and it is falling apart. Not steady, both of the flowers broke in half. I try super gluing but that didn\'t work! Disappointed. I
  I have 2 cats who both love this. It&#8217;s small yet sturdy. Very easy to assemble. And it&#8217;s cute!<br/>I would order again.
  I like this little cat tree a lot, however the base comes folded in half and relies on a washer and screw to keep it straight and stable. After a few weeks I noticed it folding up despite the washer. I think I\'m going to have to attach the base to a board to continue using it.
  but it smells so horrendous very strongly of what I\'m guessing wood? I did not like that I\'m literally writing this review in the middle of the night because the smell is stuck in my nose. I\'m sniffing a candle as I write this by the way. other than that my cat seems to like it and is already using it. It\'s also very cheaply made it doesn\'t look that way but once you put it together you can tell. if i could go back to the moment before I buy this i wouldn\'t buy it. thanks for coming to my ted talk
  This cat climbing frame has a reasonable design, complete structure and functions, the spacing between levels is right, and it also has the function of grinding claws. Cats like it very much. The installation is also very simple, with a small wrench attached to the shelf, it will be installed in ten minutes. The cat has a new home and jumps up and down, so happy!
  Cheap base is two pieces and designed badly, does not fit together very sturdy and collapses when the the tree falls due to instability.
  i&#8217;ve had this cat tree for a month and it&#8217;s already falling apart. the cardboard on bottom has separated from the carpet, so only the short purple flower can stand on it&#8217;s own. i&#8217;m going to replace the cardboard for wood, but repairs shouldnt be necessary for a $60 cat tree
  Super cute but very very flimsy. Doesn&#8217;t hold up.
  Easy to assemble but much smaller than expected
  Very cute, but very small. My adult cat can fit on the orange seat but not the flowers. Definitely for small kittens.
  The tower was easy to assemble and so incredibly adorable, but the quality is nothing close to what i was expecting. The bottom piece broke almost immediately. Read the reviews AFTER purchasing and saw that this was happening to many people. Would not buy again !!!!!
  My cat tree didn&#8217;t assemble. The tall tower either had a stripped screw, a missing piece, or the screw was too short. I contacted the company over 2 1/2 weeks ago with no response.
  Loved this cat tree when I I first viewed it. It was colorful and different. However, when I received it, it was a total disappointment.  The cat tree smelled terrible, it is very poor quality. This item should not be for sale at all. I usually do not write reviews, but felt I had to with this item.
  Great looking &amp; really easy assembly!
  It&#8217;s very cute and relatively sturdy but my cat barely fits the bed. My cat is 1 year old and 10 lbs. She still likes to lay in it tho so I will keep it. She also loves the hanging ball.
  Cute little cat tree  My cat loves it
  The cardboard is cheap and snaps in half. It is flimsy and does not hold the cat
  Easy to put together and looks great! Cat loves the ball.
  this is a great cat tree! it&#8217;s so cute and I love it! I also posted it on tik tok and it&#8217;s absolutely blew up! I&#8217;m so sorry if this inconvenienced you!
  That\'s all it took for these fur babies to have something new to scratch and play on. It was super easy to put together,came with everything I needed to put it together. As you can see it\'s already a fan favorite!
  Came fast, great seller!!
  This was very easy to assemble and my cat loved it from the start. It&#8217;s colorful and goes with my eclectic taste.
  The bottom is not sturdy at all, my cat broke it in a few months. It completely snapped the bottom part in half, and now it won&#8217;t stand at all. Would not buy.
  Love it so much it&#8217;s so cute and easy to assemble, although the directions are wrong and you&#8217;ll have to follow the picture to get what it should look like, the directions make it smaller and the picture makes it bigger!!
  my kitten loves this &amp; it&#8217;s so cute! she doesn&#8217;t sit on it but she loves playing with the hanging puff ball and using it as a scratching post!
  &#160;This item is mostly for a kitten. Too small eventually for a 1 year old cat
  East to assemble, but not very stable.  Better suited for cats under 10 lbs.  I do like the colors.  Not the same boring beige, brown, or gray.
  This tree is too small for my average sized cats to fit in. It looks pretty good tho. It&#8217;d be good for kittens.
  Pretty easy to assemble, it is really sturdy and now my kitten can look out the window. Kitty approved!
  Looks exactly like the picture very easy to put together and very cute!
  Very cute, but the based broke the first time the cat jumped off it. Not very stable either. Very wobbly.
  It&#8217;s broke after a week
  This cat tree is cute but the spot where cats can lay is so small, a full grown cat will not fit on it
  Went together very easily. I wish thy did this design in a taller tree!
  My cat loves it. And so do I I&#8217;m happy that I found a cat tree that was cute, functional, and it didn&#8217;t break the bank. Building it took me about 5 minutes and it was pretty self explanatory on what to do as well.
  I didn&#8217;t get all the right screws so one of the pieces won&#8217;t stand up straight and falls overs
  I had it for 2 weeks before my 3 lbs kitten broke it by jumping on it too hard. It&#8217;s very flimsy. Will not be buying a new one.
  Unfortunately this only lasted about a week before one of the posts fell off and couldn&#8217;t be put back
  Cheaply made, broke a month after having it. Would not recommend this item.
  I\'ve had it two weeks and the base already broke.
  Love the colors and tree itself but is a little flimsy and wish it was a little taller. Overall not bad.
  broke on the 3rd day
  My cat never played with it and when he did it Broke
  So cute and kitty loves it
  So cute and my cat scratches it all the time. Just slightly unstable
  Kitties love it! Had to put a lil catnip on it to warm them up to it but they literally fight over it now.
  Super cute and pretty sturdy. Small tho, probably best for a kitten or small cat
  very small and not as sturdy as one would hope.
  Not sturdy at all and is very small
  Slumped &#128564;
  This cat tower is adorable! My cats were interested into it right away! Took me about 3 minutes to set up. Very easy to do. It\'s actually really stable aswell. The cats jumped on it and it stayed Still. The cats can now relax in peace on some beautiful flowers in the sky. Would definitely purchase again if I had more cats
  I saw all the great reviews. I was so excited, but what I got compared to everyone else&#8217;s photos is not the same. Like they got name brand and I got knock-off/returned product. The max height on mine is 20-21 inches- the description says 26&#8221;. I checked the instructions and did nothing wrong. The posts are so close together it was hard to get the flowers on. I had extra pieces?!<br/>It was easy to assemble and very cute, but I will be returning because this just really isn&#8217;t what I ordered in terms of dimensions.
  &#160;This is such a cute little cat tree. Everyone who has stopped by the house has commented on how cute it is. When I moved recently a mama cat who was pregnant adopted me and then she had 4 kittens and we kept them all. This cat tree takes about 10 minutes to put together and it is very easy to assemble. It is soft and very well made. My kittens love it and jump all over it.
  &#160;I love how cute and very colorful this cat tree is. I chose this one as I thought the flower shape was adorable and I needed something for the cats to scratch and play with so they would stop scratching my furniture. They really enjoy batting the ball around and have enjoyed the scratching post. My cats are big boys but they still love this little scratching post! It&#8217;s held up well and it was a very easy assembly.
  &#160;Quick and easy to assemble.  Came with easy to follow instructions.<br/>It is bright and colorful and our cat loves to snuggle in the top part. She\'s a fairly large cat and this is sturdy enough for her to scratch and climb all over
  This is an absolutely adorable spot for my kitty&#8217;s to hang out!  They just love it. It&#8217;s the perfect height to sit in front of the window so that the cats can watch outside.  Delivery was quick. Great price!  It was easy to put together. And my cats love it!  5 stars all around
  My fur babies LOOOVE it&#128571;&#128571;
  Well worth the money. The colors really catch my cats attention. Material is soft for napping.
  Great product for a great price! This tower is sturdier and easier to assemble than cat towers double the price. And the cats love it!
  Really cute. It is wobbly no matter how tight you screw the poles in. And it could\'ve been a bit taller for the price. But cats love it.
  This adorable cat scratcher is great for kittens 1st scratching post, the baby soft carpet, small platform and pompom are the perfect inviting space for kitty to play- compact and fits great in front of windows to give kitty a great view
  Just as described. Worked great! Nice quality and great value and price. Theses things are just perfect.
  baseboard broke within about 3 weeks. my cat was under 9 when we got this
