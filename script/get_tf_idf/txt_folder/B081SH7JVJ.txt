  I\'m usually lazy about reviews but am writing in hopes of helping more products like this flourish in the market, because we really need more of this stuff. My dislike of carpet and faux fur limits my options greatly, and this cat tree is a godsend.<br/><br/>- The gray slate wood is lovely and looks better than most human furniture in my house. Not only is it beautiful, but it\'s also more affordable than most other carpet-free cat trees that are simpler in design. For the price, this is an incredibly high quality piece of furniture to spoil your cat with, and even comes with a full sized screwdriver and easy-to-follow IKEA-style instructions.<br/><br/>- Unlike most cat trees that have open top perches, the rounded and walled top perch on this cat tree allows my cat to curl up and lean safely. The hanging toy is a bonus that allows the lazy cat to become a little more active.<br/><br/>- Kudos for the little pad you can velcro onto the wood surface so the cat doesn\'t get cold while we still get pleasing aesthetics. The fabric has the pleasant feel of flannel pajamas.<br/><br/>- The bottom box is quite low, and comes equipped with a thick, fluffy cushion - perfect for an aching senior cat. Bonus points for the cushion being removable.<br/><br/>- The proportions are well balanced; minimal lines, tucks nicely against your wall or corner, offers plenty of height without being overwhelming, while packing very diverse resting areas -- a safe little nest to snuggle in, an open space to groom and lounge, and a top perch to curl up or bird watch. It meets all my cat\'s needs and she stopped using any other bedding.<br/><br/>- Each resting surface (top perch, velcro pad, box) fits a petite cat with a bit of room to spare. For our 8lb cat this is a deluxe condo with plenty of surface area, but if your cat is 22lb, it\'s gonna be a tighter fit.<br/><br/>- One of the side boards to the enclosed box came with a deep crack that threatened to break off the entire length of the box. We stabilized it by putting the other parts together and fastening them to hold it in place. But if not for this workaround, we would have had to go through the hassle of a return process after having spent half an hour dealing with the assembly, and the frustration would have dampened our spirits about this considerably.<br/><br/>- Some of the holes for the screws were not uniform.<br/><br/>- Due to its many parts, it\'s inevitably less stable than a solid piece of furniture. The highest perch, for example, wobbles a bit when my cat moves.
  My cat took to this tree immediately, and spends a lot of time snoozing on the top perch. It looks exactly as advertised and is very aesthetically pleasing. I was able to assemble it relatively quickly, and I am not talented in putting things together at all. I actually got a few things wrong at first, and was still able to get it all put together in about an hour. It\'s sturdy, doesn\'t wobble at all when she hops onto or climbs it (and yes she has climbed the scratching post a few times), and the dangle toy is still intact! So far, she hasn\'t used the cubby yet, aside from poking her head in at first exploration, but it takes her a bit to take to enclosed places.<br/><br/>Overall, a very nice looking cat tree/condo if you\'re looking for something of a more reasonable height and have a single cat.
  I do not enjoy and am not good at putting furniture of any kind together. If I found it easy to assemble you will too. I was happy it included a screwdriver. My kitty is declawed so she doesn\'t use the scratching posts. She is 13-14 pounds and it is sturdy. She loves the toy it came with (there is an extra one included which is nice). The color is what you would expect.  All the positive reviews made me purchase it and I am very happy with it! The measurements are accurate. I think it an excellent value for what it costs.
  Absolutely love this cat tower! Wanted to buy something a little shorter to be placed in front of a window for my cats to people watch. They took to it really quickly and have really loved sun bathing on it during the day. I think it&#8217;s a great size overall to give them plenty of space. It&#8217;s very ascetically pleasing which I love compared to a lot of other towers. The one thing I would say for construction- the piece of the cubby with the hole for them to get in (at least for me) was cut so that it had to be put in a specific way to fall flush with the rest. It&#8217;s a square piece but I guess not technically even. I don&#8217;t think it was mentioned in the instructions there was a certain way to slide it so then I just realized that turning it and putting it in differently was what to do. So not a big deal at all but just something to know if putting your piece in the first time makes it not fall flush.
  This was very easy to put together. Did it in a 1/2 hour. The second I finished, my cat got up from where she was and jumped into the cubby hole. The height is perfect for my window which is 40&#8221; from the floor. She also uses the scratching posts regularly. I like that it isn&#8217;t made of carpet. The base  and top perch are made of fabric but won&#8217;t leave carpet fibers all over. The cushion for the cubby hole is a little flat so I just put in a blankie on top of it to make it softer. Happy cat. And isn&#8217;t that all that really matters?
  I like this thing. It was easy to assemble, it looks perfect in my house. My cat is 4 y.o and  has never had anything like this before, so he was freaking out for a little bit, but started liking it very soon.
  It&#8217;s sized for kittens. My cats don&#8217;t fit in the cubby or on the top shelf. It&#8217;s not comfy or enticing so they don&#8217;t use it at all. It looks better than most cat trees but not useful or practical
  &#160;I&#8217;m am just thrilled with this product it&#8217;s the purrfect gift for my two new kitties. They play on it all the time. They were hiding under furniture often before I got it. I also love they won&#8217;t scratch on my furniture as much. My 15 year old granddaughter put it together easily. it&#8217;s so pretty. I read the reviews on many other one looked very cool but had a review saying a cat got its paw stuck in it. this is the best bang for the much and love the contemporary look.
  This product is VERY well made.  The materials aren\'t cheap -- they went above and beyond making this product.  They include a full-sized screw driver to help you assemble the product.  I had a lot of fun building this cat tree!  It\'s cute and fits well with my furniture.<br/><br/>My cat hasn\'t taken to it yet -- she is more of a burrower than a climber.  I just needed something for her to scratch on and possibly get used to hanging out on it than laying in my new recliner and scratching that up.  :)
  This is a great product! Very easy to put together, and it comes with everything you need, even a screwdriver. The height of the top perch is perfect for my cat to look out the window. My cat is just under 10 pounds and fits perfectly in the cube and on the top perch. If your cat is much bigger than that, I would recommend finding another product. It\'s a tad wobbly, but pushing it against a wall was enough to stabilize it. The toy ball that comes with it entertained my cat for about an hour before she snapped it off. But still very much worth the price!
  I spent ages shopping around for a cat tree that was aesthetically pleasing, or at the very least, palatable to look at in my living room. My cat has FOMO very badly, and would never use a cat tree unless it was in the main living space. This tree is modern and cute, but blends in with my decor style. It was easy to build, I think it took 15 minutes and I was chit chatting as I worked on it. My cat is on the heavier side, but does fit in the top perch. If you have a large cat it might not be a comfy fit.
  Love the modern look of it, it is much more attractive than most cat trees. My two cats absolutely love it, and love that there are multiple places for them to lay comfortably. It is sturdy. My one cat who is rather fat loves the little box that she can crawl in and fit comfortably inside.
  Super cute, modern cat tree. We have a smaller sized cat who weighed (prior to the Covid) about 8lbs. She is compactly in the areas for her and she has enjoyed it since putting it together. Our 11 year old son, who loves anything to do with building or tools, put it together with ease.  Looks great, just as the picture and we are pleased with the purchase as it goes well with contemporary decor.
  I first bought this cat tree and then also bought a taller one by the same company. The quality of both is great and they are super easy to assemble! The cubby is on the smaller side and fits one cat great but is a little tight for two, even tho my older kittens still smoosh themselves in there. Highly recommend this!
  Most cat trees have never been updated in style. This is one of the few modern looking ones.<br/><br/>Super easy to assemble. Someone with basic skills could probably do it without having the instructions in hand... it\'s that easy to figure out.<br/><br/>I like the removable pad and pillow... Makes cleaning MUCH easier than the carpeted ones.<br/><br/>VERY happy.
  Our kitten absolutely loves this cat tree. He loves jumping up each flight and laying on the top perch looking out the window. The only annoying part was it came slightly damaged (see attached images) with a chip in the wood, right in the front of the tree in perfect view. We waited so long for it to arrive we didn\'t want to spend all of the time it would take to return it and purchase a new one. Otherwise, it\'s great.
  Okay, so the baby girl absolutely loves it and actually uses all parts lol.  I would have like it to been taller but just stacked it on something I already had and added some of her favorite pillows and rest things.  She place with the having ball thing every single time she jumps up onto it, multiple times a day.  She will spend hours sleeping there.  Seriously. See image
  &#160;I placed it in the bedroom for access to the chest &amp; window.<br/>My 20lb boy enjoys it.<br/>He sleeps in the top part, too.<br/>My other 11y.o cat does not use it.<br/>Wish it was a bit shorter for her to jump on.
  my cat really loves this tree. it\'s super sturdy (she\'s 10lbs) and she loves to play with the little ball on it. she\'s a little big for the top round perch but she doesn\'t seem to mind as she\'s always up there lol
  Great little cat tree for the price. I was able to put the pedastal on the opposite side which was nice.
  My persian boy loves his new tree/ condo as we call it. So chic and we\'ll made. He loves the top round bed he lies in it more often than the box near the bottom even his fat Garfield lookin self kinda hangs off the sides a little haha he gets the zips and climbs up and attacks the toy. And I love how the toy screws in and comes with an extra toy as well.
  I really liked that it was modern looking and not covered in all that outdated beige carpeting stuff, either. My little fella was climbing all over the kitchen counters, so wanted to get him something else to climb and this has done the trick so far. Unfortunately, he doesn\'t use the enclosure, though, so I wish there was an option for another scratching post and shelf or something else in it\'s place. However, regardless, it was still a great find and I\'m very pleased with it.
  This product is pretty cool. Nice cat furniture, with fun modern appeal. Easy to put together. Relatively sturdy,  jury is still out on the top platform. But our 2 yr old cat loves to sleep up there and its holding good so far. Our kitten likes the bottom. :-)
  It was easy to put together (very similar to other furniture assemblies). I have two cats and they have both enjoyed it very much. It&#8217;s more modern looking and the perch seems to be the favorite thing. If I could change one thing, I would want the cat scratching posts to be slightly thicker in diameter, but they still use it.
  I was really excited pulling the pieces out of the box. This is the most modern and simple cat tree I&#8217;ve come across and I was delighted as I assembled the pieces. Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t until the very last piece (top perch) that I was disappointed the hole was too big for the screw so it can&#8217;t screw into place. I am now left with an awkward cat tree ;(
  My cat is finally relaxed.  My puppy irritates my cat so bad she was running out of places to jump on. I brought her this and she\'s in love...it sits by our screen door so she can look out at nature and don\'t have to worry about our puppy.
  My cat loves this! We have a small apartment and wanted a cat tree to put in front of our window that wasn\'t too big or too much of an eyesore, and this accomplished that! Our cat likes sprawling across the second tier, and sitting on the top level to watch birds. She also loves the little ball! Great product, thanks for keeping our cat occupied!
  Easy to assemble. Sturdy as all heck. Came with clean parts, everything setup nice. Couldn\'t be happier with this purchase. Perfect for my young cat, she loves it!
  The cat tree was super easy to assemble. Everything was labeled and the instructions were clear. I like the modern take on the cat tree, really blends in with my furniture. Doesn&#8217;t take a lot of space and my cats really like the resting hole.
  My cat likes it. I wanted something smaller and modern. The cushion on the top is a little small. Overall it has a clean look. My cat is used to a tall bigger one but, this was a good compromise for a new one in my apt.
  Bought for my upstairs. Cats really like it. I forgot to click on the $5 off coupon, so don&#8217;t forget!
  My cat loved putting it together. Although now he just visits it but he does use the scratcher all the time.
  Well made, perfect for bigger cats.. our fatty loves it!
  So amazing<br/>I LOVE the look<br/>I love theres no ugly Carpet<br/>So cute<br/>Really really amazing material<br/>Even comes with a screwdriver and extra of EVERYTHING
  The lone tower piece makes me cat feel a little uncertain when she gets up there, not her favorite place. But overall I love the look and design of this.
  MY cat loves it and I\'m so glad I made the purchase. Sturdy materials with sleek design. I think it\'s a great value and now want to purchase another. It just blends right into my decor and gives my baby a place to get away from the doggies.
  It took a little while to assemble but it was pretty easy. My Bengal and Ocecat love it! &#128571;&#128571;
  The thing broke in half after only a few months of use! Scared my cat and my toddler  when it broke too!
  I wanted something that looked a little more modern and had the colors of our living room. This was perfect! The cats seem to really like it!
  This cat tower was just the right height. My kitten loves to look out the window on the highest tower bed. It was fairly easy to assemble, I would use a drill to really screw everything in to add to the sturdiness. My cat loves it and the color is great and modern.
  so easy to put together, came with all the tools and parts as well as some extra pieces and a replacement ball toy! My cat is obsessed.
  Absolutely LOVE this. So happy with my purchase. Very sturdy and only took 15/20 mins to assemble!
  As soon as I completed putting the tower together my cat made it her own. Perfect size for my apartment. I didn&#8217;t use the circle opening for the cube but left it open. Also attached a piece of sisal to the outside of the cube for an additional scratching area.
  Sleek, sturdy, and functional.
  My 7 pound cat loved the tower. After several weeks, the seat tower became wobbly. My daughter tried to tighten it and the cardboard structure under the scratch post broke. This made the seat tower useless.
  Our vacate love it. Comfortable extension of their window view
  This is a beautiful cat tree. My 2 cats love it. Very sturdy and the price was fantastic. Definitely recommend.
  It looks really good after assembly. It is easy to assemble and my cat immediately started using. She isn\'t a large cat so I\'m not sure how the tallest stand would be for a bigger cat. She enjoys hanging her head off and sleeping.
  Super pretty! My cat loves the felted material! Doesn\'t look like a cheap carpet!
  My 5 lb kitty loves this piece. She perches to watch the birds and naps in it during the day and at night. I like the scale for a small cat and the more modern design works well in my bedroom.  It is very well made.
  This was super easy to assemble and a the best looking cat tower I&#8217;ve come a cross. I would definitely recommend!
  This is a very well made cat tree.  Easy to assemble.  The cat loves it!
  Wouldn\'t get if you have a bigger cat.
  Love the way the cat home looks. Simple/minimalist. Cat loves it. Easy to assemble. Sturdy.
  If you&#8217;ve ever assembled anything from IKEA you&#8217;ll be fine. Easy to assemble. They even gave you a screwdriver for assembly and a few extra parts. Very pleased and the cat loves the box the tree came in. Lol!
  Easy to assemble. Well packaged. Great cat tower.
  Super happy with mod design for this cat tree/scratching post! Five meow&#8217;s for sure.
  Easy to assemble; provided all necessary tools; very sturdy; like the added pillow for cove and pad for open area; value for money; and Jettson LOVES it... actually Love at first site!!!
  It was really easy to put together, looks very lovely and our three cats love it! Great value!
  Easy to assemble and my cat loves it!
  Easy to assemble with step by step picture instructions. Very attractive modern tree that&#8217;s easy to clean. Perfect for a small to medium sized cat. My Persian loves it!
  It\'s really cute and stylish my furbb luv to sit on top looking out window and sunbathing &#129322;&#129322;&#129322;
  Kitty loves the product, she&#8217;s around 4 pounds and it&#8217;s very sturdy! We also tie other toys to the tree so she has lots of options to play with. :)
  So cute! Pumpkin loves it &#128525;
  Reasonable price, looks great, easy to put together
  Just what I was looking for. Well made, great design. I love the clean look of this. My cat Maze went on it right away.
  Easy to assemble, sturdy and large enough for an adult cat
  Very easy to put together. Nice looking in a small apartment. Overall very very pleased.
  Easy to assemble! My cat loves it!
  Attractive modern cat tree.. not a cumbersome eyesore

  Easy to set up. Cat loves it and it&#8217;s pretty much where she&#8217;s at all the time now.
  My older cat and kitten love it, there can use it at the same time to look out the window at the bird feeder
  This is a very nice looking cat "tree". It takes about 30 mins. to throw it all together. They even included extra parts. Also an extra hanging toy! Its very sturdy and well made. One caveat is that the back support on the top seat was a little bent in; from the way it was packaged; but not enough to warrant returning it and really not that noticeable. Its cardboard or something else like that. They probably figured anything else might crack in the shipping. The best thing is that this fits in my small kitchen and Sparkles my 5lb. kitty can stay out from underfoot. Last but certainly not least is that the minute she saw it she climbed into the "box". She sat there awhile and then jumped up and inspected the rest. She tried out the toy and presently is "perched" up top. She was  watching but is now sleeping from up there as we eat dinner. She immediately took to it and so did we! Not too small or too big. Just the right size and she has plenty of room to grow and it will still accommodate her!<br/>P.S. Update...The backrest I spoke about is covered with fabric and the "bend is slowly coming out over time. She absolutely loves the top perch and would spend the entire day sleeping up there if she didn\'t need to come down for food, water or the litter box. Btw the other day I was about 6 feet away and on the phone and she rolled over in her sleep and fell off the perch backwards and hit the floor before I could catch her. She was dazed but fine. I just wish there was a "safety net or bar" across the open side of the perch. So I\'m glad that this cat "tree" is no taller than it is. Height is something to think about when you buy one of these :)
  The package was lost in the mail and the seller responded promptly and followed up regularly to see what I wanted to, eventually sending me a replacement free of charge. Very happy with the customer service!!<br/><br/>My kitten loves the cat tower. He started using it immediately. After scratching the posts myself he also started scratching them. He loves running up and down it when he is playful, and sleeps on the bed at the top. So far he isn&#8217;t very into the enclosed box but I&#8217;ll try to get him into it with treats and toys. Pleasing to look at too, blends in well with my modern, minimalist style. Not an eye sore like most cats beds!
  This cat tower is of great quality and very well constructed. My cats enjoy it every day and I am pleased with my purchase. It is a little smaller than I was expecting but that doesn\'t detract from the quality or my recommendation - just something to consider.
  I\'m very happy with this purchase. It\'s well built, easy to assemble, and my kittens love it.
  I appreciate the visual aesthetic as well as it having no carpeted surfaces.  Assembly was simple, but time consuming. Fairly sturdy, though it\'s only been in use less than a month; only time will l tell....
