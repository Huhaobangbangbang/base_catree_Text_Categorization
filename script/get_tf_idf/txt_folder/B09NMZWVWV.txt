  This is the second time I have purchased this triple post scratching &#8220;tree&#8221; for my three cats.  When I purchased my leather sofa, I invested heavily in various items for them to scratch on.  THIS was their fav!  It only lasts about 3 months but for 3 cats, but I am pleased.  Very easy to assemble!  Both times the box was delivered with large tears/openings.  They need to package the product in more sturdy shipping boxes.  I WILL purchase again!!!
  This works great for my large cat of 20 pounds to use as a step.<br/>He also likes to lay on top of it. I put some heavy duty double sided tape over the 3 bottom bolt heads. The bolt heads are not countersunk. Did not want to scratch my tile and needed to keep it from moving. My 20 pound cat can get crazy wild.<br/>His little sister of 12 pounds doesn&#8217;t really need the step but she likes using and laying on it. She does use the carpet post to scratch on. Both play with the balls when laying on top. I am very happy with the purchase. Serves my purpose using it as a step. It is also the perfect height for a step and looks nice. I purchased the grey.
  This cat scratching toy was easy to assemble! My cat was sitting on the parts while I was putting it together because she couldn&#8217;t wait to play with it. She finally wore herself out scratching the posts and playing with the fuzzy balls. She&#8217;s about 8 lbs and almost 14 years old.
  It fit my (and the cat\'s) needs. I just needed a small one by the door so the cat can sit and look out. She knew what it was for when I put it there. Plus she needed new scratching posts and this has three nice ones. It\'s pretty sturdy. I sit on it to put my boots on and off.

  It\'s awesome but my new cat isn\'t interested.  LOL. I\'ll give him some time to warm up to it.  I do recommend!
  my cat loves it.  she likes to lay on top of it and hang off the side to scratch (yes my cat is weird)  I have 4 scratching post and she uses all of them but sleeps on this one a lot
  The piece itself once fully assembled is solid and stable which is what we were looking for, but the downside is it was missing one of the assembly screws and we literally watched as one of our cats took a swipe at the orange ball and it went flying apart literally less than 5 mins after it was fully assembled.  If you are just looking for a small scratching post for your cats it is fine, as long as you get all of the parts to assemble it, but I would not rely on the toys lasting too long, they seem to be poorly made and loosely attached.  If not for the missing part and shoddy toy quality it would be a solid 4-5 star piece.
  Love the product it&#8217;s little but very fitting for my 3 cats thank you so much
