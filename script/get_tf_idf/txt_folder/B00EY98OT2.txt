  We have two adult cats of average size and this is the first cat tree we purchased for them. Our grey cat spends many hours lounging atop the perches and occasionally sleeps inside the house. The other cat immediately took to scratching up the posts in fits of obsessive fury - so much so that, within a few weeks, the sisal rope was completely shredded and I discovered what the posts are made of: cardboard! Hollow cardboard cylinders, wrapped with thin sisal rope. If I had caught it in time, I could have prevented permanent damage to the structure. However, I did not notice just how much our cat loved scratching the post until a large hole (about 5" long) had developed! It was at this point that I went to Lowe\'s and purchased much thicker sisal rope to re-wrap each column (all were showing similar signs of wear, just none as advanced as the favorite post). The cats have been using this post for about a year now and it is time to re-wrap a couple of the posts again. The hammock is useless in our household since neither cat cares for it. The little ladder doesn\'t matter one iota to either cat, nor does the small platform it attaches to. It does assist in adding stability to the tower, though. We haven\'t had any problems with wobbling, but the tower is also on a tile floor. I can envision it wobbling if placed on carpet. The brown carpeting tends to show fur rather easily but I still prefer it over boring beige. All in all, I do like this cat tree. It doesn\'t look terrible in the home and doesn\'t break the bank, either.
  Easy to put together AND well made. I was surprised at how nice it is in person. I always say shopping online is similar to dating online, since things (and people) can easily be altered to look super perty.<br/><br/>Our cat, Finn, is in 57-inch high heaven. Finally, he can jump up on something high and not be immediately accosted by weird sounds from the humans, who are also snapping their fingers and lurching toward him to get him while shouting get down, g-d**nit! I swear he really is smiling. Can\'t blame him.<br/><br/>Seriously, I honestly did do a lot of research to find a good value-for-the-money cat tree that doesn\'t take over a third of your living space, and this does not disappoint.  If I had the capital, I would gare-anne-tee your complete satisfaction. But I don\'t have that power, and I\'m not even a Vine member; I just felt compelled to review this while I had a few minutes. I thought there might be other cat owners sitting at their screens who are thinking, good lord, this is like shopping for a refrigerator: So. Much. Information. Head. Will. Explode. In 3-2-....<br/><br/>If anything changes in the product rating, I will update. That I can gare-anne-tee!
  My cats love the tree, and spend hours sleeping, and fighting over the top shelf. It\'s been almost a year since I set up the tree, and it\'s held up well. It sways a little when the heavier cat jumps up, or if both of my cats are playing on it, but it\'s never fallen over. If I had a more permanent place for it to be set up, I would screw it down to the floor. The scratching posts are starting to fray, especially the post holding up the top shelf.<br/>Overall, the tree was very easy to set up, even with two curious cats trying to figure out what I was doing, and it is definitely a naptime favorite.
  My smallest cat @ 7# loves it but managed to rip the fur the very first time she got on it. My large cat @ 16#\'s will not even get on it. The scratching posts are much smaller around than our old one. We are already making plans to Beef this up a bit. Wish I would have ordered my other choice.
  Like everyone\'s reviews said, it is wobbly the higher up our cat goes. She\'s 12.6# and seems to like it (although she was much more interested in the box it came in... Typical)  She\'s not a fan of hammocks to begin with, but she most definitely wouldn\'t fit in the one provided.  She doesn\'t use the ramp, but I think it\'s more for support anyways.  I like that the scratch posts are in the center of the individual platforms instead of at a corner of the square like on the other cat tree we have. And the price couldn\'t be better!
  ***DON\'T*** buy this! It is a POS. The "pressed wood" CRUMBLED as I was ATTEMPTING to connect the first piece to the base.  LITERALLY, no joke... the sisal Allen wrench screw "ate through" the "pressed wood" as I screwed it in place and within a minute of screwing the piece on (the FIRST piece) it separated from the base. The ONLY WAY this "tower" could ever be even assembled is if you loosely screw the pieces together and hope they are tight enough to hold it in place yet loose enough to not break through the "pressed wood". And then hope that your cat NEVER uses it. I have assembled COUNTLESS items with pressed wood. This makes cardboard look like mahogany.
  The cats love it. Easy to assemble. 4 stars because it is a bit wobbly but other than that its awesome. Comes just as described and I have been having almost a year. Still in great shape. The cats have worn 1 scratching post out but I just had to rotate and I know I can swap it later down the road too with one that does not get used as much.
  Lasted only about 10 months of part time use (we have 2). Was wobbly from the start, and eventually, the ramp broke. The scratching post rope shredded very easily compared to our other/older tree, and the last straw was that one of the perch stands completely broke and toppled over in the middle of the night. Don\'t bother with this cat tree.
  Our cats seem to really like it.  Had to drill new holes to move the brackets on the steps/ladder piece so it would line up with the other holes on the first perch and fit together properly (they were about .25" off) but that was the only thing that needed adjusting to fit together properly (as per the instructions).
  Best investment I\'ve made.  I\'ve purchased many cat perches before but this one seems to captivate my cat the best.  It was easy to put together and doesn\'t take up a lot of room.  I took out the bottom hammock as my cat didn\'t seem to be interested in that at all... otherwise, great product and worth the money.
