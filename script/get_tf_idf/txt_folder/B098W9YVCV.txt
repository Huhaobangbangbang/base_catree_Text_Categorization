  This is the crowning piece to my cat wall. It is a bit tricky to install though, especially if you put it up as high as I did. You need to use a provided template to drill 4 holes for the attaching screws will screw into (easy part). The hard part is, after assembling the house, you need to attach it to the wall, lining up holes on the back of the house to the 4 holes you drilled earlier. The house is not light and you\'ll probably need the help of an extra set of hands. It\'s not clear from the instructions, but this is NOT TO BE INSTALLED IN DRYWALL. That said, I didn\'t catch that and only found out after installing and reading more reviews on Amazon. I installed into one stud (coincidence), so it feels pretty solid. Sidenote, this was the last piece I added and I "eyeballed" the leveling after being so careful to level all the other pieces. You can\'t tell from this picture, by my eyeballs were wrong! This house is a little crooked. I have a Catsuit Mario plushie I\'m thinking of attaching as if he\'s dangling off the edge, making the house tilt with his weight. Then I\'ll tell people it\'s crooked on purpose :P
  I&#8217;ve purchased a few FUKUMARU products, and so far they have all been amazing. This cat house is super sturdy and heavy duty&#8230; I have no worries that it will fall apart or get torn up over time. Unlike other FUKUMARU products&#8230; this was a little more difficult to assemble and might have been a little easier with a second set of hands. Spend the extra money on good products like this, it won&#8217;t disappoint.
  The wood looks nice and well made but face panel (B) arrived broken. I do not think it was worth the money for receiving a broken product. The company has reached out and wants to make it right. Good customer service goes along ways. I glued the broken peices back together and my cat loves it. My mom just got 2 kittens and I have the best gift idea! Thank you for your experience FUKUMARU
  Maybe if the instructions were included, I\'d see where I went wrong trying to put it together but after 2 attempts of getting it on the wall and piece by piece, if falls apart, that was all I needed. The 2 stars is I like the IDEA of the house, just need a better, overall structure.
  Only buy if you&#8217;re willing to do an hour of research on how to mount it correctly to your type of wall. They shouldn&#8217;t even sell this as a wall mount because of how heavy it is. They advertise &#8216;only mount on brick or cinder block&#8217;. OK.<br/><br/>Still haven&#8217;t found a good way to mount it
  It&#8217;s a nice piece added to my cat wall. The only 2 complaints is that it&#8217;s super heavy and one of the piece didn&#8217;t have holes to connect to the other piece. I had to industrial glue it together. It worked and it&#8217;s cute!
  Adopted an extremely sick which is now healthy! Didn&#8217;t know how we would mix or if he&#8217;d feel comfortable with me. Giving him space other than just hiding behind stuff on the ground was important. I did have to have someone come over here to install all of that. My cat is in love!
  The box wouldn\'t hold together correctly. Any amount of pressure made the front and floor part fall off.
  We plan to use these in our cat rescue adoption center. It is very important for cats to be able to escape to safety, or retreat when they need space. These are awesome and perfect for our needs!
  This is a great cat house! It&#8217;s sturdy and well made, and looks clean and modern on the wall. I like that it doesn&#8217;t have paw prints or other &#8220;cat&#8221; icons on it, like some other cat furniture. We also got the Fukumaru hammock and stairs, and they have all been great.<br/><br/>A WARNING:<br/>- It&#8217;s heavy! Absolutely do not attach it to drywall alone (or use the included anchors) we actually drilled 2 extra holes in line with a stud, so that we could have three sturdy screws directly in the stud. Then, we got the most heavy duty Molly toggle bolts they had at Home Depot for the holes that hit drywall. You don&#8217;t want this tearing out if the wall and falling to the floor with your kitty inside!<br/><br/>Our cats stated exploring right away, and they love their cat wall!
  My cat wouldn&#8217;t use this until I added a sisal pad into the bottom. When cats jump and land, they need a good grip.
