  &#160;I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to put this together.<br/>Packaging: This came in a box (as depicted) that was within another box, therefore the stuff inside the inner box was OK even if the exterior box was dented or squeezed.<br/>Pieces were of good quality, with everything being soft and well-assembled. There are no rips/tears or areas of concern. The nuts, bolts, and allen wrench were all made of genuine steel, not cheap plastic.<br/>Assembly: It was not difficult to put this together. (about 45 minutes) It works excellent if you follow the assembly instructions to the letter. I only had two problems: 1. Because the pieces aren\'t labeled, you had to "find" the correct piece and hardware to use on it&#8212;but there aren\'t many to get mixed up with, so it worked out fine. (There was one bolt that was shorter than the others, but it was in its own bag!). 2. The screws did not always "catch" as quickly as I had hoped. Screwing the covered box hole down to the base, for example, needed a little force to get it correctly. It was also difficult to line up holes to screw "blindly." But none of this was due to a manufacturing defect; it was simply a case of "lining it up." Simply take your time, note where the holes line up, and then get to work.<br/>Sturdiness: In the end, this was a strong build. If I needed to, I could easily and confidently move it around the house. Nothing was strewn about or cause for concern. Because the pouch basket swivels (depending on how tightly the poles are locked around it), you can put it around the pole wherever you like! (Because my kitten is too little to jump from it to the nearest platform, she liked being able to walk down in the center.)<br/><br/>Overall, I\'m pleased with the quality and ease of construction. Everything is incredibly soft, and I expect my kitten to spend a lot of time playing with it.
  &#160;My cats LOVE this tree. I bought it to replace their old bedroom one and they immediately took to it. It&#8217;s super easy to put together and the perfect size. My cats are full grown (2 1/2 years old) and the orange boi isn&#8217;t smol. He&#8217;s a chonker and as you can see, it&#8217;s not bad for his size! It seems very sturdy even without the anchor.
  The directions were not very clear, but after studying the pieces for a few minutes we figured out how to assemble the cat tree and our oversize (read fat!) cat had no trouble understanding how to use it! It\'s nice and sturdy and doesn\'t wobble or tilt, something I was afraid of since the cat really is quite large and heavy.
  They state that this product is tip resistive; IT IS NOT.  The base is light weight and flimsy.  The product is not sturdy.  I placed two bricks on the base and secured it to the wall and is it still tippy.  My cat will not use it because  it is not stable.  The instructions for assembly were not specific and two parts were incorrectly labeled.  This product is made of substandard materials, is not easily assembled and is basically useless.  I wish I had never wasted my money on this product.
  My cat lovessss this treeee it&#8217;s his first one! he&#8217;s about 10 pounds so a medium cat it&#8217;s pretty shaky but we put the tree next to the window so he could see so we could just put the strap in the window and it keeps it stable for him &#128513;
  I&#8217;ve had this for 2 months and the top bed is a bit wobbly and my cat has started falling off (he&#8217;s 12lbs).  It was easy to assemble but at this point I&#8217;m going to need to replace it with something sturdier.
  Chunky cats beware! Works for my big cats but the hammock is too small. So they store toys inside it.
  Absolutely love this.
  The cat tower was easy to assemble with the attached directions and tools. Also, the fabric lining on the tower is very soft!
  My cat loves it very sturdy and the height is perrrrrrrr fect &#9786;&#65039;
  My cat loves this cat tree. Well worth the Money. Easy to put together.
  I have two cats who love to lay on this tower and watch our neighbors walk by outside the window. They love the scratching posts as well. Assembly was ok but got a little confusing when you had to assemble two posts close to each other. My cats are very chunky so sometimes the tower wobbles a bit when they get on it, but it never tipped over, so I\'m actually impressed. If you need the extra protection though, it comes with one of those straps so you can screw it into the wall. I love the grey color. One thing I\'m sad about is my cats seem to not care about the hammock at all. It just kind of sits there, always empty, as they compete for the top bed. The little house on the bottom is a hit. Both cats love sleeping in it, and chasing each other through the holes. Overall, this is an amazing cat tower and my cats definitely approve.
  This cat tower is quite a bit larger than your average small cat tower. It can just support all four of my cats on it at the same time. The flat scratcher tier is a nice touch for my older cat who prefers to not scratch above his head and my younger ones love fighting over the ball from the upper and lower beds. I don\'t expect the ball to last long, but they never do in my household!<br/><br/>Putting this tower was about as frustrating as putting together any other cat tower. The instructions were average- not super detailed, but not difficult to figure out. It is a pain to line up the screws with the support poles inside the cat house and the stickers had fallen off some of the support poles. It is easy to figure out which ones they are though.<br/><br/>The antitip device is a strap that is screwed into the wall with a screw and sheetrock anchor. It seems to do the job for now, but my cats like to play with it. It will probably go either way whether or not it lasts because of this. I do wish that it was a removeable feature as the tower seems sturdy on its own, but it\'s not a serious enough drawback for me to factor it into my rating.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great cat tower that my cats love so far! It\'s a good height and full of features to keep them interested.
  &#160;My cats absolutely love this cat tower, so we\'ll start there.  If they are not in my lap, they are sleeping on this tower. It is very cozy and comfortable, but that is where it ends.<br/><br/>It is very unstable and cannot support larger cats without leaning to the right. There simply is not enough support. It needs one more pole in the front plus a larger base.<br/><br/>If you have kittens, this would be perfect but not so much for larger cats. My youngest male is 20 pounds and it wobbles when he jumps to the top. When both my male and female are on the beds, it leans to the right.  Even if I did use the wall mount to prevent the tower from falling over, it would still lean to the right.<br/><br/>I would give this tower 3 stars, but my cats love it so much that I will give it 4 stars but only because they love it.
  This fits perfectly in the corner of my house. It\'s not too big or too small. My larger cat maybe too large for it but it\'s perfect for a medium size cat or kitten. The little hammock is perfect for my kitten to sleep in. Both of my cats enjoy the 3 scratching stations. This took my husband and 9 year old son about a 1/2 an hour to put together. They said it was fairly simple to follow directions. I really like the fact that the top part comes off and you can put it in the washer and wash it. My 5 month old kitten really enjoys the ball with the jingle bell. It\'s made out of very nice fabric and it\'s soft. It does come with an attachment to be able to put on the wall to make this more sturdy so it will not tip over. I decided not to do it.  I think it\'s sturdy enough for the cats to jump in-and-out of without it tipping over.
  The cat tree arrived in a compact box, and I was pleasantly surprised at the soft, fur-like fabric covering the majority of the pieces.  I took everything out, it&#8217;s all there!  Assembly is pretty straight forward, I suggest installing the four pillars that go in the bottom cube from the top first, followed by the four screws from the bottom.  Everything else went together easily, with my cat getting more &amp; more interested as time went by.  I had it all put together in about 20 minutes, and it seems stable &amp; should be able to withstand whatever she decides to do with it.  Who knows though, she&#8217;s a fickle cat&#8230;my hope is that she&#8217;ll be more interested in this than bothering my husband during his important work meetings&#8230;I doubt it though. &#128572;. Overall, it&#8217;s a nice cat tree &amp; worth the price!
  I love everything about this cat tower. It\'s the perfect height. It\'s really soft. It\'s really easy to assemble. It has the best platforms. I have a 5 yr old and he loves his special perch. It has a little side perch with a sisal platform above. He loves jumping from the perch to the sisal where he lays and watches everything because it\'s the perfect height. The top platform is comfortable and large enough for him. I use the side basket to keep all his fluffy, crinkle and belled balls which I put out at night for him to play. If he wants to play anytime, he can reach in and paw one out. It was really easy to assemble. The instructions are very clear and the parts were labeled. For the money, this is the best cat tower I have ever had.
  I took my time, so it took just under an hour to get the whole thing together. You can see from the first picture, my cat was a barrel of laughs climbing in and out while I was building it.<br/>All the pieces lined up correctly and none of the screws or washers were missing.<br/>This is the first large cat tree I\'ve gotten for the little feller. He likes the hanging bell the most. He won\'t go in the hammock, even with catnip. When I move it into its permanent spot, then I will bolt it to the wall for more support.  It seams pretty sturdy, but Jack is a big boy. The price on Amazon is $60, which I think is fair. The boards are also sturdy and the fur is extremely soft.
  This is the mother of all cat condos.<br/>It&#8217;s really amazing and has a lot of fun stuff for your cat.<br/><br/>It is a bit overwhelming at first to see all the parts to put together. It&#8217;s fairly easy though and my husband had it done in under 30 mins.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>Three levels<br/>Cat bowl/hammock<br/>Scratching posts<br/>Scratch pad as one level.<br/>Top level Is a cat bed area<br/>Built in toy<br/><br/>Super soft<br/>Sturdy with an option to attach to the wall so your cat won&#8217;t tip it while jumping off/onto it.<br/>My cat couldn&#8217;t wait to move in.<br/>Nice thank you note included.<br/>Def recommend this one.<br/>&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;
  My big boy likes it. My cat is 17 pounds of pure furry beauty. He adores this thing, and spends all of his time in the top tier. I worry about the hammock piece under the weight of his voluptuousness.  He uses the other tiers as a route to get to the top and spends little to no time on them. I suspect that is because the platforms themselves are small while the top is large.  This would make a great cat tree for kittens, but my big bubba loves it still.<br/><br/>This was easy to put together. No instructions, but looking at the picture was more than enough. Took me about 30 minutes, but I also had my six year old slowing me down, I mean helping me.
  My initial opinion is that this cat tree would be too small/unstable for my chonky kitty. However, this cat tree comes with a wall anchor strap and screw which works extremely well. This extra security allows my kitty to play and rest without worries of her chunkiness causing a tipover. She weighs approximately 10 lbs.<br/><br/>It was easy to build and is a good size as well. The fabric is very soft and doesn\'t shed.<br/><br/>My kitties love it and I am very happy with the purchase.
  &#160;I love this cat condo and so does my cat. The color grey is pretty. The material is plush. The footprint is small but the size is big. There&#8217;s lots for the kitty to keep busy or just take a nap. The top cover is washable. It was well packaged and easy to setup. There&#8217;s such a difference from the ones in the store and this high quality cat tree. It really is five stars!
  Assembly was very easy, about 15 minutes. Very sturdy, and our 9 pound kitty fits nicely. She loves the top bed for naps and takes her toys into the bottom house to hdebthem from our dog. Thebscratch pads and posts seem good quality and she took to the entire set up very quickly.
  A little smaller than expected, all my big boys hang out and off of it, but they like it anyway because they\'re cats. They scratch on it all the time which is what i really wanted it for anyway so it works.
  Bought of course for my cat. It was easy to assemble and directions were perfect. My cat absolutely approved and loves it. It&#8217;s definitely made to last and very durable. Worth every penny!
  This cat tree was pretty easy to assemble and is a nice medium size. My cat loves it and wouldn\'t leave me alone while assembling it for him.
  This purchase was all around awesome!!! I probably researched every cat house on Amazon and a couple other sites. Based on reviews and the slightly larger size of the two beds on top, I chose this Yaheetec Cat Tree Condo. Let me say, I just have one very spoiled 7 yr old Bengal. He is very smart, very vocal and very curious. It did not take him long to move right into this Cat condo! It&#8217;s very soft and offers so many places to cat nap he will never get bored! He has tried them all too! He loves the scratch pad on the bottom level and naps down there too! Very easy to put together.
  This product was easy to assemble taking 30 minites to unbox and assemble. It\'s sturdy built and even has a way to attach to a wall. Roomate\'sa fat cat can sleep in basket with out bending it. Great addition tocatifacation
  The cat tower is super easy to assemble. The height is perfect. Our 2 kittens can climb freely, sleep in a hammock and a top nest respectively, and like to use scratching posts and a scratching board. Very recommended!
  &#160;This cat tree is for a small cat or 1 medium cat, not recommended for a big cat or more than 1 cat. My cat only sleeps on the top, the hammock is too small to sleep in even though my cat is small as you can see in the video. The instruction is clear, easy to assemble. Overall is a good product.
  Easy to assemble, perfect size , good quality
  My cats love this tree so much! Both cats laid in it for hours after it was built and while building as well! this is sturdy and it does take a little while to build but so worth it! 10/10 recommend this!
  Just fantastic!! My cats love it.
  Nice feel to the fabric and pretty easy to assemble. Would recommend as a gift for a fellow feline lover. Feels very sturdy after fully assembled.
  cat loves it
  I purchased this cat tree for a mom cat and her 6 kittens. Mom can use the tree (for now) to get away from her brood by going up to the higher branches - she is a little too big for the cubby hole. The kittens (5 weeks old) love to get inside the cubby or on top of the cubby. It\'s not too high that if they (ungracefully) topple off that they will get hurt. It doesn\'t seem to deter them from getting back up on the top of the cubby.<br/>The fabric so far is holding up with all the little ones scratching. I noticed a bit of fuzz in their kennel but I think that\'s due to the newness of the fabric - I probably could have taken the vaccuum to it first.) I was worried their little claws would get stuck in the scratching post and they would need help getting removed - so far all is well.<br/>I do recommend using the included screw to attach to the wall - it is stable if you don\'t -- with little kitties near the bottom. As they get bigger and explore the top areas I think it will need that stability of being attached to the wall.
  Smaller than the picture, a bit flimsy but works great for a cat that wants to lay in the window.
