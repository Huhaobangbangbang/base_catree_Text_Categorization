  My cat absolutely loves this scratching post! He\'s very picky about them, so I was very happy about that. It was very easy to assemble and seems to be high quality. This is very sturdy, too; my cat a large cat, so often knocks posts over because he\'s so heavy, but this one stays up. If you\'re looking for a scratching post for a large cat, definitely choose this one!
  My Feral Cat loves the tall scratch posts &amp; works out on them several times a day= the sisal gets fuzzed out &amp; still works. So much better than the cardboard scratchers-which my cat literally scratched up in a week &amp; then I spent countless hours picking up &amp; vacuuming up cardboard pieces. I have one scratch post in each room &amp; over the last 5yrs. haven\'t had a problem with the sofa, rugs or wood furniture being scratched on.  Before the scratch posts came in tall sizes I was buying 3 or 4 &amp; extending them.  I am happy with these &amp; will continue to purchase them.
  &#160;Have had this for a few weeks, and my cats still scratch on it. They destroyed a wicker hamper, so I put this in the spot where the hamper used to be. It&#8217;s so much better. The wicker scraps were everywhere. This does not shed like that. Very sturdy. I would recommend it. The video clip shows that my cat likes it, but prefers his brother&#8217;s head.
  If you buy the 34" post, you\'ll need to refer back to the photo on Amazon because the directions that come with the easy-assembly post don\'t show the middle fabric and ball piece. This post is rather tall, so cats will not be climbing it. If they try, they might topple the post. Our more curious cat was eager to sniff out this new post as soon as it was put in place (replacing one that the two cats have managed to shred). Sisal is a much better choice than corrugated cardboard, which can send tiny airborne particles into the noses of our feline friends. Yes, the sisal slowly shreds and sheds, but it\'s easy to remove from the base with a simple brushing. I do wish that these manufacturers would use carpet fabric instead of the white, fake-fur material, which very quickly becomes dirty. Our previous post had a base of a mottled brown carpet fabric that never looked dirty (even though it probably was).
  I had previously purchased a 6&#8217; cat condo for the new kitten but she wasn&#8217;t too interested.  Then I purchased this and she hasn&#8217;t stopped playing with it yet!<br/><br/>Super easy to put together also.  It took me about 10 minutes and it took that long because she wanted to play with it.  Best money spent!
  Bought this for our two very active kittens and they LOVE climbing it! I recommend the scratching post for older kitties, not the one for babies, because the babies grow up in no time, and bigger kitties  won\'t outgrow the larger post. They scramble over it constantly, and love playing with the hanging fur pouf balls that are attached.  The base is very sturdy and it is, overall) well-made.  Very easy to assemble.
  I foster kittens for an animal rescue in my town, so I have several scratching posts at home.  I have three fosters right now, and they all would ignore the scratching posts in favor or my upholstered furniture.  As a last ditch effort, I ordered this scratching post.  It was an instant success.  They love the new post, and, oddly enough, have even started using the other posts as well.  They love this one the best, though.  Thank you.
  We really needed something to take her off the sofas and this really did the trick. It was the easiest thing to put together and she enjoys it quite a bit; she almost tackled it, haha. Anyway, wonderful buy. Would 10/10 recommend.<br/><br/>Update: The other two boys took to it as well! Happy it wasn&#8217;t a waste. Will add pictures of them, too.<br/><br/>Update of the Update: the little ball on the string came loose. Not as durable as previously thought, so a star will be removed. Aside from that, it&#8217;s still pretty good.
  With 4 cats we have purchased a number of scratching posts; they have always had a recessed spot for the screw so as to not damage the floors. This scratching post does not have a recessed spot and thus is only going to cause damage to my hardwood floors. Perhaps it would be ok on carpet, but even then it may destroy the carpet over time as the screw protrudes a significant amount.
  I admit I can be cheap. But this baby was definitely worth every penny! Our 3 little claw babies have been tearing into this post everyday and it hasn\'t even fallen over once. The base is a good size to prevent it from toppling over. Mine is 36" tall and one of our kitties loves to s-t-r-e-t-c-h up tall and loves the little hanging fluff balls. The sisal on it is strong and glued on pretty well - it may not last for another 6 mos. but this thing is doing a great job for now and I\'d be happy to purchase another one.
  It was much bigger than I initially expected but no complaints there. The bottom half of the scratch post material is already coming off though after only have it for a week or so. I can see the wood.
  Very easy to assemble. Works great when I show my cat how to use it. Now, if she will just use it it would be nice. She likes the corner of my bed instead but it looks very nice sitting on the floor.
  The tube is just thick cardboard and the tube separated from the base in only 2 months use. We have 2 Persian cats that are under 8 pounds each so it was not something that received a lot of abuse. Not durable at all.
  Easy to assemble &amp; comes with an allen wrench so you didn\'t need tools. My cats love it, it\'s the perfect height for them to claw standing up, and not too bulky, fitting in living room fine along with the color scheme.
  Height is adequate but the diameter of the pole is quite narrow and it is very light weight. One of my cats attempted to use it but it moved and he immediately lost interest. I bought this for the cats to use until I can rewrap their other ones.  I will keep it but possibly change the bottom.
  My cat loves the post and took to it straight away.  Arrived within 24 hours and was setup in 5 minutes.  Very happy.
  I have 3 of these around my house for my 3 kittens. They love to run up them and balance on the top. Great scratcher with the added benefit of being a toy!
  They probably could have used more rope, was like this after 2 days.
  Looks nice when first together.  Sisal rope starts to work down.  After a month  backing is exposed about 2 inches on top of both sections.  Other ones we\'ve had didn\'t do this.  There should have been more rope rope for this not to happen.
  Bought a different post first, green one that looks like cactus, cats wouldn&#8217;t even go near it. 10 seconds after this was assembled one cat was already using it. They don&#8217;t seem to care about the balls and it&#8217;s sturdy enough where our year and a half can climb it and it supports his full weight no problem. Would buy again.
  We have had a lot of fun joking about our cat on his stripper pole. He seriously loves this thing and being a bigger boy, it&#8217;s sturdy enough for him. I may need to put something on the bottom to keep it from slipping when it&#8217;s not on the carpet.
  The office kitten likes it very much.
  Easy to put together and the height is great!
  I only bought about a month ago and my two cats have already almost scratched the rope on the bottom off.
  I bought this item because it\'s 34" tall which allows my adult cat to fully stretch while scratching,  It easily assembles in about 5 minutes with the supplied allen head.  It has two attached balls which my cat plays with and another attached separately to the large base (16"X16"} so no tipping hear.  Compared with similar items it\'s also a bargain at about half their price.<br/><br/>I highly recommend!
  The two adult cats looked at it but didn&#8217;t touch it. It&#8217;s been up for over a week and no scratching has occurred. They prefer the old wider posts in the house. I didn&#8217;t realize the post was smaller in diameter than the other posts we have. This would be better for kittens in my opinion.
  It does exactly what I needed, which is to protect the corner of the couch. They have pulled it over once or twice but I usually just keep the corner of it wedged under the couch and it holds. It\'s nice and tall, providing my boys with a nice stretch. They don\'t care much about the little attached toys but they love to scratch it.
  We only have this one post for out two kittens. They use it quite often. If they start scratching on furniture we simply gently carry them to the post and they continue on the post. They seem to gravitate toward this more and more as they grow. They also often play on or around it.<br/>While it\'s a skinny pole, they both enjoy climbing and standing on the very top.<br/>It was completely simple to assemble. It comes in compact packaging. The construction seems plenty sturdy for our needs.<br/>I cannot think of any negatives.
  So, I received this item and immediately after looking at the directions realized that there is a whole entire piece missing. The whole spring part, which is supposed to screw into the base, isn&#8217;t even in my package. I don&#8217;t really have the time to send it back because I&#8217;m trying to train my cat, but in essence, I paid to only receive a part of my order. There was also cardboard already exposed on the actual post upon opening the package. Next time, I&#8217;ll probably just splurge a little more to buy my sweet baby a quality toy that he really deserves.
  My cat loves the scratching post it&#8217;s a decent size and every morning after her stretch she goes up to it and scratches on it instead of my couches so I am loving this scratch post!
  Nice height for kitty stretching.  Base it too small so it wobbles.  Biggest complaint is the pole itself it connected to the plastic connectors with little staples that are easily pulled out of the plastic ring holding the pole onto the base. There are also staples at the top which were concerning as kitty could get his claw caught in them when stretching to scratch.
  I had rescued a trash kitten and he was a big climber. Needed something verticle.<br/>He cannot get enough of climbing it and perching on top. My older cat loves to scratch upon it as well.
  Highly recommend! All my cats love this and they haven\'t scratched walls or furniture since &#129315; so far it has held up well would definitely buy again
  This cat scratching post was assembled in less than 10 minutes.  Seems very sturdy.  Cat is loving the extra play toys that are a part of the post and base.
  Scratch pole is just the right size for small kittens.  They play a little with the puff on the rope.  It\'s entertaining and good exercise for the kitties.
  My cat is a tall huge cat and she loves it! It&#8217;s not too short like most of the other cat scratchers. Excellent quality! Very sturdy. Easy to assemble
  My cat loves to scratching post. Very durable and the color actually maxes are accent wall, hence the reason why I purchased it. That\'s a solid product.
  Luna, my rescue kitty loves her new scratching post almost as much as she likes the arm of my new living room chair!
  It has a small footprint so it doesn\'t take up a whole lot of space. The balls and doodads keep the cat occupied. Over all it was a great purchase.
  I\'m really pleased with this purchase.  It came together really easy and the cats put it to the test immediately.  We\'ve only had it for a week so time will tell, but the construction looks and feels like quality and the price was much better than Petco.
  assembled in about 2 minutes<br/>Pretty good solid base they haven\'t knocked it over yet
  My little girl kitty pie loves this scratching post, she started using it as soon as I assembled it!
  &#160;My two cat love this scratching post, the two toys don\'t turn when assembled. They went right to it once I opened the box, went crazy when put together. I put catnip at the bottom.
  was easy to put together and looks really nice.  Waiting to see how my cats react to it..
  My kitty has long legs,  this one is perfect  so she is using it  instead of chair
  Seems to work well for the demon child
  I like the height. But the ball on the base came off pretty easily. The cats still seem to like it.
  About the 10th scratipost in the last 6 years<br/>This one is the MOST DURABLE
  Easily assembled and my 9 month old took right to it. This scratching post is the perfect height with little distraction from anything other than that.
  Nothing to dislike.  I set it near the side of my couch to save it from claws - it worked. She uses the post now not my couch
  I ordered this a few weeks ago for my cat. She really liked it and at first was able to use it multiple times a day. I noticed it seemed to be leaning one day and when I went to adjust it the whole thing just collapsed. As you can see in the picture, the scratching post is still intact, but the connection where it screws in was too weak. Very disappointed.
  My 2 pound kitten tore this to shreds almost immediately which also made a mess everywhere. This is the only scratching post I&#8217;ve had this issue with and he&#8217;s not particularly rough on toys. It&#8217;s not durable. I&#8217;d recommend purchasing something else.
  I&#8217;ve only had this for a few days but my cat seems to love it. Great way to deter her from scratching the couch. Doesn&#8217;t seem to be falling apart (yet)
  My cat needed a scratcher and this was a great addition
  We\'ve only had a month and have already had to toss the balls that it comes with out. The stand is next. It\'s not durable enough for a kitten. The cotton started coming out just a few weeks later.
  Very easy to assemble, super sturdy and durable for the price. My cat Kiwi loves it and honestly if you&#8217;re thinking about it. You should get it.
  Easy to put together. Great price! My little girl loves this!
  I got this for our new Maine Coon kitten. I am not sure it will be sturdy enough when she gets older. It has good  height but the base is a bit small.  When she tries to climb it, it wobbles.  The diameter of the pole is not big enough.
  I really like these and they did not cost a lot, either.
  Really good&#8230; I like the fact that it is tall for my larger cat as well as my smaller cat&#8230; Although the smaller cat like to climate also &#128522;
  Easy to assemble
  My cats just love this scratch post
  My cat loves this scratching post! She used it right away. It was simple to put together and I\'m very pleased with the price!
  Very tall so my cat (who is a bit large and long) loves the height of this scratching post. It was missing one of the washers (supposed to be 2) but was able to assemble it without it, if it becomes an issue I&#8217;ll just run to the hardware store and grab a little washer. The blue is such a pretty color!
  Better than advertised, bought three of them. Sturdy and durable.
  It\'s has lasted longer then I thought it would
  My cat loves this! Easy to assemble and so far so good .
  It was a good value for the money but not very sturdy
  This is a nice big scratcher very sturdy and looks great in my house. Compared to others I have shopped for this scratcher is a great deal..cats like the toys attached
  The problems are: the pom-pom easily tore off the wire holding it when the cats played with it (and the stuffing went everywhere) and the whole thing falls over when they use the scratchpad or pull at the upper Pom-pom.
  I liked it my kitty liked it and it was quite easy to put together
  My cat loves this scratching post and the little toy entertains him!
  Super easy to assemble. My cat loves it, although she doesn\'t know to sit at the base of it to scratch, so it does topple over sometimes. As far as durability goes, it\'s relatively new, so we shall see!
  Kitten loves it. Climbs it daily
  my cat  absolutely loves this scratcher she runs at it then climbs it to the top.
  My cat wasn&#8217;t interested in this at first, but once we moved it near where he used to scratch the couch he&#8217;s loved it! Very sturdy and easy to assemble, and my kitty uses it every day. Great purchase! Cat picture for tax lol
  My kitten absolutely loves her new toy.
  Not very sturdy will not last large cats
  This appears to be a good product. However, my cat is a stinker and refuses to use it LOL She prefers the cardboard.
  It\'s fun for my kitten. Keeps her busy.

  Excellent toy for keeping your kittens off your furniture
  This scratching pole fell apart after my kitten used it twice. Not worth the money. I would spend a little more for a well made durable product. Waste of money and a disappointment!!
  Both cats love it. Assembly was quick and easy, too.
  Kitty approved
  The scratching post is used frequently by my 3 cats. The more they use it, they less my furniture gets scratched!
  My cat loves this scratching post
  Easy to put together, cat liked it, but rope broke within 6 months.  Only have one cat on this pole.
  Easy to assemble.  Assemble board could be a little bigger. Tips easy.
  My kitty loves it. She keeps jumping on top.
  This was super easy to assemble and is sturdy. My cat loves to climb and scratch this post as well as play with the hanging toys.
  It is a little on the small side, which is totally fine. My kitten loves it! It is a little unstable, so be careful with that.
  Well designed, looks nice, the cats use it all the time.
  My 2 cats showed no interest at all. Had horizontal sisal product before that they loved. ??
  &#160;It works well. Kitten loves it.
  Arrived with a missing part, I reached out to the seller and they sent the part and some extra toys too. My cat loves it.
  Easy to put together
  My cat really enjoys this it\'s very good quality
  It broke after 30 days ! No return!

  I bought one of these over a year ago when I adopted my cat Maxwell.  In that time he has gave that post a beating every single day and although a lot of the cord wrapping is pulled off- it has stood up to the his daily abuse in fine style. Max is a Norwegian Forest Cat. "Wegies" are climbers and they have extra strong claws that grow back extremely fast after a good trim. Max also has a six foot high cat tree as and he can use his front claws to pull himself up to the top, so I needed a good strong, ultra durable cat scratcher for him when we brought hi home.  There are several features that I love about this post.  First the base is wide and attached to the post very securely. As strong as Max is- and he is tall enough to reach about twenty inches up the post- I have never had this tip over. Heck, it has never even moved during the most furious scratching session.  Second, I like how it comes in two heights for extra large cats and average size ones. Also, it is built of really durable material that can take a beating and last for a very long time.  I HIGHLY recommend this post if you got a cat that loves to scratch. In the time I have had this post Max has never touched a piece of furniture with his nails. He  loves this thing as  much as I do!
  One of our cats old scratching post started rocking back and forth every time a cat tried to use it so I chose this one as a replacement.  From a human viewpoint, assembly is a no brainier using the included tool. Its the small additions that I appreciate, such as the large washer on the bottom that should stop any more rocking, plus the small rubber feet in each corner to keep it from sliding around. Its also not overly large or tall and fits perfectly in a corner.<br/><br/>The feline viewpoint is shown in the posted images. Its received the full nose check from our 6 cats and they seem to really enjoy the spring loaded puff ball, puff balls being a favorite in our house.<br/><br/>Final verdict:<br/>Human: 5 stars<br/>Cats: 5 stars<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this review and I hope its helpful
  Besides this 22&#8221; post and the 34&#8221; post on this page, there is also a 29&#8221; post on a separate page, which I also have.  They are identical except for height.  The taller one can tip over (due to the somewhat small base), which hasn&#8217;t happened with this shorter one.  (Of course, the best would be a tall one with a larger, heavier base, since my cats love to stretch up when they scratch, but they have a cat tree for that.)  Decent but far from fancy.<br/><br/>But that&#8217;s JustMe.  (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)
  i adopted a 9 yr old cat  and after a fwe days f us getting to know eachother i bought this for her. was not sure she would even use it. but from the start she loved stalking the ball on the spring and now using it all<br/> well worth the money and was so easy to put together!  spend more time watching her play with this during the week even putting a book down to watch her<br/> im sure any cat will love it<br/>my cat is almost 10 years old and a small 8 # cat
  This is easy to put together and made with real rope, which my cats like. It is a little bit short, so I would not get it as your main scratch post, but as an additional one, it is great. Or for kittens. Overall pleased.
  As you can see from the picture, this is not a huge scratching post, but it\'s a good size for kittens.  It does stay put and doesn\'t fall over, and the kittens love the dangling ball to bat around.  They compete to climb to the top, then bat each other to keep the others off the top.  Good quality, nice looking.
  This is easy to put together and works great. My cats use it and love it. Pretty basic product and works great and exactly as described.
  My husband and cat put it together. My cat above this post. Way more than his $150 cat tree.
  Owner reviews, price + product dimensions helped me choose this on Amazon.  I was hoping to find one suitable for both growing kittens and adult cats (over 30" height -  most listed on Amazon were under 2feet).<br/><br/>I decided to adopt my last 2 kittens due to my age.  After this batch, I\'ll likely be adopting senior cats in need.<br/><br/>My cats are outdoors/indoors, so I needed an indoor scratch post to keep them away from drapes and furniture.  My adoptees took to this post right away, how grateful and blessed am I!<br/><br/>It was very easy to assemble, and what I especially liked is that I CAN ASSEMBLE IT WITH ONE POST (LOWER HEIGHT) for the kittens; THEN, AS THEY GROW, HEIGHTEN IT BY ATTACHING THE 2ND POST.  The 2 dangles and whack-a-puffball have been an absolute draw + deeelight to watch!<br/><br/>I cannot review its durability, but can edit my evaluations later if necessary.
  I wanted a smaller scratch post so I could move it to different areas where behavior was happening. This fit the bill perfectly. My kitten\'s love to scratch the wrapped sisal as well as play with the attached balls. Sturdy with no tip-overs yet. Written directions for assembly were a joke but pretty easy to put together after I ignored them. Can\'t speak to durability yet but it looks as well constructed as any others I\'ve seen.
  My cat is in love with the giant cat tree at my parents house that has the tall scratching posts but I didn\'t have room for one like it in my house. I found this and he loves it. He\'s a pretty tall cat but he can still climb up this scratching post and act crazy! Perfect size
  My cats took to it immediately.  The love it.  Pros:  Good value, fairly sturdy.  Cons:  With multiple cats the rope will need to be replaced after several months.  I would recommend this product.
  I like it it very much and my cats like it... it looks stylish and it seems to be pretty sturdy. It has kept my cats from scratching my brand new couch! I sprinkle cat nip on it about once a week to keep the cats interested in it.
  Excellent kitty loves it . Amazing how cats know what to scratch and what not to.<br/>I can\'t say how tipsy it may get when cat gets bigger put almost anything would tip over if a cat jumps at it and hangs from it.
  Big enough for our cat and she loves it. She scratches and stretches several times a day.
  &#160;I wound up getting two of these and they are both used and loved.
  Great price,easy assembly,fast delivery.thank you
  oh my gosh , i laugh at my cat daily with this post. he loves it and is on it many times a day . best thing i ever bought  him. definitely recommend .i bought because he started scratching on my brand new love seat. this has totally kept him away. going to buy a back up .
  Such a great deal for the money! (So far, it&#8217;s only brand new and I hope it holds up to two cats daily usage!) Its nice n tall, too. Recommended.
  Good buy
  My cats love this scratching post. Easy to build
  Very easy to assemble, good and sturdy and won\'t topple over if your cat is crazy like mine and likes to jump to the tippy top. :)
  Would of gave 5 stars if it was a bit taller but for the price and quality I recommend.
  My cat uses it all the time. Inexpensive, durable and it works.
  Product exceeded expectations.
  It seems well made. One that we got a couple of days before this one has started to fall apart. This one hasn\'t
  This scratcher post is very easy to assemble. I like how high it is. But the quality itself if not good. It is wobbly and the base is not very sturdy also. My cat won\'t even play with it.
  This item arrived and by the size of the box, I thought I received the wrong item.  However, once assembled, it looks great and is tall enough for my cats to stretch out while scratching the post.  The sisal material looks very durable and the post was easy to assemble.
  My cats love scratching my walls, put this in front of them, and now they only scratch it and me.
  I used these products for my 2 dogs.
  Looks good and my cat liked it, but it only lasted for two months.
  My cat loves this sturdy post...sturdy if you put a 10 lb weight on the bottem like i did that is.
  I bought this post for my cats because it is taller than the rest and it was great until about a month in the string around it already came undone. It&#8217;s holding together right now by a knot. Not the best quality
  My 6 weeks old kitty loves it! The way she entertains herself with it&#8230; it&#8217;s just amazing. Highly recommend it!
  My cat loves this and uses it often
  I assembled this fairly easily, but cannot figure out where the little fuzz ball with the spring goes.  Are there instructions?
  It was fairly easy to put together - I took the advice of another reviewer and built it upside down &amp; top to bottom.  A second pair of hands would have been useful for the screwing everything to the bottom but I managed alright.  The construction seems really solid and durable and my *large* cat has thrown his weight at it top &amp; bottom and it didn\'t tip over, which is always a concern with cats.<br/><br/>The blue accents are gorgeous - I love that color.  The rope is very prickly - the cats don\'t seem to mind it, but it was unpleasant for me to hold and felt like it kept giving me splinters as I assembled it... but I\'m fine - no actual splinters.<br/><br/>The balls got my cats\' attention right away; but they seem so interested in playing with them that they aren\'t using the pole to scratch!  My cats are finicky though - they won\'t use cardboard scratchers either.<br/><br/>So it\'s well made &amp; pretty &amp; interesting to cats... but you never know how a cat is going to use a thing so your miles may vary.
  We had a small scratching post but needed a larger one as the kittens started growing.  This scratching post has been perfect! Each of them like to climb it and play at the top and it has never toppled over.  I am very happy with my purchase!
  Super easy to put together. Maybe took 5 to 10 minutes if that. Cat loves it. Without this she resorts to the furniture.
  Great quality for the price.  Easy to assemble.  The cat scratch rope is held on tightly with what I assume glue.
  My cat doesn\'t seem to care for it unless it\'s coated with catnip lol but it\'s solid and sturdy and easy to put together. And good price
  My cat is not easily pleased by things, but he loves the scratch post. He hangs out by it all day and uses it all the time this is a great purchase
  Thank you
  Sent it back to damaged for it to be used
  Easy to assemble and fairly sturdy.  I appreciate that I am able to order this item to suit my two tall cats and it allows them to stretch as is a cat\'s habit
  No issues with the assembly.<br/>I bought this based on the multiple positive reviews but my cat\'s paws get stuck on it. He used it possibly 3 times and as to be expected, he has not touched it in over a month,  even with the sprinkling of catnip.
  Easy to assemble and my kitty uses it frequently.
  This was a very good size for the price. I have a smaller one and my big kitties keep knocking it down. I need to distract them from the sofa so i got this. Other scratchers at the same price are shorter so this is a steal. It&#8217;s tall and stable, comes with the dangling ball thing that will entertain them more. I spray some catnip and they immediately get to work lol they scratch it every day. It&#8217;s tall enough for them to stretch too. Im glad i found this after looking around. My sofa can live in peace now lol
  Not worth the money!! Looks like it may be sturdy but with 2 important pieces missing, it is impossible to assemble. Very disappointed!!
  I got this in August, it is now March. The ball toy on top got ripped off VERY early on, but I got it more for the post itself. Unfortunately they\'ve loosened the rope on the top half and the bottom half is missing for two inches from the middle.<br/>I have 4 cats.
