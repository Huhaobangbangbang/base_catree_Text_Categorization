  WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR CATS 1ST OF ALL.. IT\'S VERY SOFT IT ASSEMBLES REALLY EASY SO EASY AND THE COST ISN\'T BAD EITHER. THE THING OF IT IS THESE TYPES ARE MADE FOR LIGHT WEIGHT CATS AND THEY\'RE MADE FOR SINGULAR OR VERY FEW CATS LIKE 2 CATS IN LIGHT WEIGHT VARIETY I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE WAY IT\'S MADE. THE POLE THAT THE PADS SIT UPON WELL THE POLES SIT ON A PLASTIC CASTER AND IT BARELY GOES UP INSIDE THE POLE AND THIS IS NEEDED FOR SUPPORT . THE POLE MOVES WHEN THE CATS GET ONTO THE PAD WHICH SIT UPON THE POLES WHICH SIT UPON PLASTIC CASTERS WHICH ARE SITUATED LOW ON THE PLATFORM. THE CASTERS NEED TO GO UP INSIDE THE POLE FOR A PRETTY GOOD WAYS TO GET PROPER STABLE SUPPORT OUTTA IT FOR NOW THE POLE BARELY GETS FITTED ONTO THE CASTERS WHICH IN TURN OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU\'LL SEE THE POLE START TO SWAY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND EVENTUALLY IT TOPPLES OVER AND YOU\'LL SEE WHAT I\'M SAYIN.. I\'M NOT PUTTING DOWN THIS COMPANY OR THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE I\'M NOT THEY\'RE GOOD PEOPLE THERE\'S JUST A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW.. IT\'S EASY TO FIX AND THIS COMPANY IS AWESOME IN CUSTOMER SERVICE NO DOUBT THEY EVEN GET THE PARTS YOU NEED OUT TO YOU ASAP. ONCE I SEEN WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS I EVEN EMAILED THE COMPANY AGAIN POLITELY SUGGESTING HOW THE ISSUE CAN BE FIXED PERMANENTLY THERFORE INCREASING THEIR SALES THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND CUTTING THE REPLACEMENT OF PARTS OUT TO CUSTOMERS IN HALF ACTUALLY IT\'D BE MORE THAN HALF AFTER THE FIX.. BUT I NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY BACK AND THIS IS AFTER THE REPLACEMENT PARTS FAILED. I HAD TO EMAIL THEM AGAIN THEY REPLIED SAYING THEY\'LL GET NEW PARTS TO ME BUT I\'VE NEVER SEEN THEM..I WISH PEOPLE COULD SEE THE HELPING HAND INSTEAD OF SEEING SOMETHING ELSE THAT\'S NOT THERE..I\'M AN HONEST PERSON WHO LIKES TO SEE PEOPLE PROSPER IN A POSITIVE MANNER AND THIS IS THE SAME ATTITUDE I CARRY TOWARDS COMPANY\'S I REALLY LIKE BUYING FROM. IT\'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD BEEN RAISED AROUND ENGINEER\'S ALL MY LIFE AND WAS TAUGHT TO HELP YOUR FELLOW HUMANS I\'M SORRY Y\'ALL BUT I SEEN RIGHT AWAY HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE AND MY DAD &amp; GRANDAD WERE ENGINEER\'S AND THEY SAID IF YOU SEE IT TELL IT SAVE SOMEONE SAVE A COMPANY.. ANY WAY GET A CAT TREE FROM THESE PEOPLE THEY\'RE GOOD HONEST FOLK IF Y\'ALL NEED ANY HELP LATER LEMME KNOW I\'LL BE HERE ALWAYS..
  At first I was a bit concerned that it did not come with assembly instructions but I was able to figure it out fairly easy. But for someone who hasn\'t assembled products before it would be a little confusing. My only suggestion would be to include instructions.<br/>Once assembled, our new kitten loved it and is having a ball!
  Bought for new kitty so she has a place to escape from the dogs. Great hideaway, lounge up top, and she uses the scratch post as well. Affordable and just what we needed
  My large furry friend loves her new cat tower tree thing. Its nice and tall but not too tall. For what it is its pretty sturdy, my kitty is a pretty big girl. She likes to sleep in the top padded section and bird watch out the window. My only gripe is i wish the rope on the legs covered the entirety of the legs as she has ripped the carpet above where the rope stops in less than a week, but its not a big deal to me....she has mostly stopped clawing my furniture...
  Ordered this as a Christmas present for our 2 new kittens...  But they have been destroying our furniture, so we decided to open it early. And i am so glad we did! They absolutely love it! Plus, it is really sturdy &amp; hasnt broke even w my 2 year old climbing on it! Highly recommend!
  Took about 15 minutes to assemble. I\'m happy with how it turned out. My cat loves it and his favorite spot so far is the basket.
  easy to assemble, and my cats love it, they fight over the basket and the top. i will be buying another one soon.
  Seems sturdy! You can screw to the wall for extra support. It is very soft! Also it is easy to put together with the instructions they sent. Fast shipping. Winter loves it! It is also big enough for her to get in and have plenty room to play.
  I&#8217;ve had this in a house with up to two cats and they both loved it and got good use of it. If one was in the top area the other (who I thought wouldn&#8217;t fit) went in the small bowl hammock thing. They use is all the time and it&#8217;s not too big.
  Grandson say his cats lov the tree.

  I am very happy with this purchase.  It arrived when they said it would. Was pretty easy to assemble.  Good quality, good stability, and is eye appealing.<br/>It\'s nice and soft...highly recommend this company.
  my kitten is just learning to play with the kitty condo and shes lovin\' it. glad i purchased it.
  Good size, sturdiness and price, would purchase again
  My big fuzzy cat highly approved. Great size and value for the money.
  Perfect size!
  But he has not .
  Puurrrrfect!
  It is the perfect hight and it is my cats new hangout
  &#160;My bunny is adapting to it very well. He was scared at first when coming down because it is a little steep for him to go one spot to another. But he seems to love it! My hopes is that he will chill out more and this will help his wild adventures.
  She loves her new cat tower. With her climbing all over the parts as I assembled it, I was still able to get it put together in less than 20 minutes. It does come with a mounting bracket to attach it to the wall but I think it\'s sturdy enough to stand freely.
  Our cat loves it
  My cats love it!! There&#8217;s a million pieces to it but it only took about 20 minutes to set up, it&#8217;s surprisingly sturdy, one of my cats weighs 12 pounds and it hardly moves when he jumps on it!
  Even has strap to fasten to wall so it does not tip
  &#160;but I figured it out and my cat loves it!
  It&#8217;s big enough for my 17lbs cat and can even hold my 35lb toddler. So if you are looking for a sturdy tower for a BIG cat this one is the best I&#8217;ve found!
  The tower boards were not long enough in length and the lowered one was short about t2 inches.  The top board was short and when made to go together the support posts swayed inward.
  I adopted a feral cat that was so scared and shy.  Also he began to claw my chairs.  We bought this to change his bad behavior.  He understands immediately that he can claw this.  He loved the cave part at the beginning then later the bed on top.  Now that he is growing older (5months) he hardly uses it.  Maybe in the winter he will.
