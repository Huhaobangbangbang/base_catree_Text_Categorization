\n  Easy, easy, easy to put together.  Super sturdy, so if it isn\'t for you, try twisting a little harder.  My cats bound around this thing like crazy.  My picky kitten even sleeps on it already.  Really amazing for the price too, I mean what can you get like this at PetSmart?  Not one damn thing that\'s what.  The soft fabric appeals to them and to me because it\'s not like carpet.  Why do I want to encourage my kittens to scratch carpet?  Well I don\'t and I don\'t know why anyone else would either.  Either way, it\'s great, totally worth the money.  We added some strings and jingle balls from the sides so it\'s a full gym for them.  We purchased one of those plastic rod connecting things, well it was alright but we spent a pretty penny for two pieces and it was small.  This is much better!  Wonderful product!\n
\n  It was easy to put together. We have mommy kitty (Kitty Kitty). That name kitty kitty is her name because she was a stray and we had no intention of keeping her, Yeah Right !!!  She seemed very young and malnourished. Needless to say she got very fat very fast. A miracle you say . WRONG !!! Kitty kitty had five little kitties on our bed a couple of months later . Wonderful !!! Not hardly !!! We managed to give three away. Being the na&#239;ve dumb heads we are, we named them all and became attached to them during the suckling period. So when Morris, Dopey and Reishi left to their new homes we were very sad. Don\'t try this at home. We kept Kitty Kitty, L. C. (Little Cow, black and white like those cows) and Dora (Dora because she was the first to venture out of the birthing area hence Dora the Explorer). They all run through the house like crazed monkeys on steroids. Happy days are here again, NOT. All the leather furniture in the house is covered in raised bumps where they decided to kneed on them. It looks like some drunk blind guy decided to write the Declaration of Independence in brail all over everything . We once had a nice home . Its a love hate thing. Damn, where\'s a sack and some rocks when you need them?  Unfortunately we feel madly in love with the beasts.<br/>This cat condo has helped to a large degree. Mommy cat uses the rope covered slide for a scratching post all the time and the evil twins, L.C. and Dora scramble all over this condo like two pissed off squirrels and they love to lounge in the two comfy beds. It has helped with the brail problem. I can\'t tell you about how long it might hold up. It seems to be made ok and it will depend on the use by your wildlife . It does shed a great deal. We are pleased with it and I don\'t see this changing any time soon. I can\'t say too much right now they are watching me. They are always watching me. Send Help. Just Kidding, shhhhhh. We are destined to live in a Cat house and I am sure they are the proud owners of us.\n
\n  It\'s a fairly big cat tree with lots of cool features if you get your cat to use/play with all of them. My cat is about 1.5 - 2 years and at first he wasn\'t interested in the tree at all. Probably because it was still smelling of the glue and wood from the packaging. We ended up modifying the tree a little, i.e. we took some of the items off and only put a few on. I also sprinkled some catnip on everything so he gets interested and checks it out. My cat loves to sit on the window sill so I moved the tree right in front of it, so he can lay on the platform and on the kitty bed. He doesn\'t play with the balls too much since he\'s already about 2 years and my cat is also not using the scratching thing (the s shaped thing). He has a scratching post that I got him when he was a kitten and he\'s still using it even though it\'s totally raggedy.<br/>All in all I think it\'s a great tree and I\'m sure every kitten will have a blast on it. The tree is covered in plush fur which is really soft and the posts are wrapped in sisal so they can scratch on it. I find it to be very sturdy. My cat is about 12-14 pounds and he jumps on it without it tipping over, even when he jumps on the kitty bed. It moves but it\'s not falling over or tipping so much it\'s about to fall over. The 3 sticks with the ball are somewhat flexible and bendable but you can\'t pull them all the way down, or they\'ll break. Happened to one of mine when my kitty jumped on it. The sisal around the stick still kind of holds it in place though.\n
\n  Update at 6 months:<br/>I heard a loud crash the other night and the next day the lower perch had snapped off and flipped over.  Thankfully my cats are allright.<br/>The heaviest cat is under 11 lbs and they don\'t sleep together in the same perch, they\'re still learning to get along.<br/>The plastic base is still attached, the hollow post is upside down on the floor, and a nail brad is sticking into the hollow.  So the plastic end is simply nailed into the cardboard post.<br/>This is really poor quality to only last 6 months and come crashing down.  I would not recommend this brand or this model.<br/><br/>Update to original review:<br/>I had given this 5 stars when I first assembled it.  Within 2 days my cat had ripped the furry parts of the top 2 scratching posts, then stopped using them.  A month later, both top posts are very wobbly.  Yes, I had carefully tightened everything using the supplied tools and strength.  But this item is not built as well as a previously purchased cat condo.  I don\'t think it will last the summer and was not worth the cost.<br/><br/>My recommendation would be to try something from Armarkat rather than Go Pet Club, as they seem more solid for long-term use, in my (somewhat limited) experience.  Pay attention to bad reviews as these are not really returnable, I didn\'t keep the original packaging and it would likely cost more to return than it cost to begin with.<br/><br/>Original review was glowing but was more of a first impression:<br/>So far, so great!  My cat couldn\'t wait for me to finish assembling, he was checking it out during the process.  He\'s about 15 pounds and has no trouble getting in and out of the cubby or using the perches.  This model is sturdy compared to a smaller one I have, it has a wider base and doesn\'t tip.<br/>I expect to get my money\'s worth from this model.  If the sisal starts to come apart I\'ll get out the hot glue gun and fix it, or even buy a roll of sisal and replace it.  I hope kitty begins using the scratching "wave" instead of my carpeting.  (You can lead a cat to a scratching board but you can\'t make him use it.)<br/>Should there be any design flaws that appear, I will update my review.  But so far this seems like a good sturdy model at a great price.<br/>The box weighs about 40 pounds and is bulky, so I had someone place it near where I built it. But I had no trouble assembling it myself.\n
\n  We\'ve only had this less than a day, but it\'s been a hit with one of our two cats so far.  We adopted Jackson, a (now) seven month-old kitten, in late December to be a companion to CK, our nearly eight year-old cat, who lost his 18 year-old companion, Maestro, in mid-December.  Jackson is a typical kitten - he is a ball of fur and love who just wants to play - and CK is a big boy (18 lbs) who will play a little bit but then loses his patience and wants to be left alone, leading to hissing and occasional loud screeching.  We wanted to give CK options to escape Jackson, and to give Jackson other ways to play.  Jackson was all over this cat condo as soon as it was assembled (and assembly was easy).  CK is wary of climbing, though... he has shown interest in the tree and lays down next to the s-shaped scratcher, but he hasn\'t gotten on the tree with his own steam. We have placed him on the platform next to the cubby, and he stuck his head in the cubby, but did not try to go inside.  Jackson is having a ball, and has explored all areas and has been playing with the three balls; I will be hyper-vigilant in trimming his claws, though, because it seems like it would be easy for him to get hung-up and injured, possibly severely.<br/><br/>I was ridiculously excited to receive this cat condo, and I am hopeful that CK will start using it, too - especially since it could offer him some peace from Jackson.  It is pretty sturdy, but we\'ll add some weights to the base for added peace of mind.  It was easy to assemble, and the color works well (a bonus, as the color wasn\'t really even a consideration).  I like it very much; I just wish that the cubby had a larger entrance so my CK could (would?) use it. I would have given this item five stars but for the fact that I\'m writing this less than 24 hours from receiving/assembling it... we\'ll see how it stands the test of time.\n
\n  Pro:<br/>My two kittens love it.  So much that they\'ve torn apart two of the play balls.  Maybe that\'s normal and expected.  So far everything else has mostly held together.  Ships together in one box, with Tetris-like precision of everything fitting inside itself.  Assembly wasn\'t /that/ difficult, but I can see your average consumer having some difficulty -- the directions are not that great.  I half expected the carpeting to have all kinds of smells and outgassing, but it didn\'t.  The cats claw this thing relentlessly, which makes me glad I got it early (when they were only about 5 weeks old).<br/><br/>I wanted to give this 4 stars, but I couldn\'t, and here\'s why:<br/><br/>Con:<br/>The highest platform actually wasn\'t fully put together inside the carpeting, so I had to take a razor blade to the outside edge to get back into the inside and re-seat the grommet that the pole screws into, and then glue all the carpeting back.  Time will tell if hot glue was enough to hold it, but so far it\'s more stable than before.  But I shouldn\'t have had to do that.  It was just VERY poor quality build on the manufacturer\'s part, and as heavy as this was (and having read other people\'s failed attempts to work with the manufacturer directly on missing parts and the like), I knew returning it wasn\'t worth the hassle.\n
\n  I have a large, energetic cat who is very hard on the things he enjoys. I didn\'t expect this to last for years but I did hope it would last more than a few months. The thin fur that covers the cat tree had holes and was falling off by the end of the first day. One off the hanging balls fell off by the end of the first month. My cat loves to run and jump on the tree and the perches then enthusiastically jump off. The base is not heavy enough to stabilize the tree so it tips over a lot. Also, the perches are connected with access through plastic. Unfortunately the plastic broke and one of the perches fell off. The sisal rope also disconnected from the favored scratching area.<br/>Although my tree didn\'t last, if you have a smaller cat I suspect it will last much longer. My can is 16 pounds of muscle and energy. He has extra toes to add to the scratching power. He absolutely loves being on the perches so he can look out the window. I suspect that any cat tree in this price range would not hold up to his use. If you have a smaller cat that is likely to be less destructive this tree would likely last much longer.\n
\n  I recently got a kitten as my sweet cat passed in August at the age of 19 and I knew it was time to have the companionship I was missing. I ordered the Go Pet Club Cat Condo before I brought the 11 week kitten home and she has enjoyed it so much. I showed her the lower bed as soon as we got home and the next day I found her in the high bed watching traffic go by! I read the reviews and I don\'t know how anyone thinks it is not stable. If it can stand up to the romping of my kitten, it can stand up to anything. She plays rough and she can jump straight up into the air at least 3-4 feet and come down with a THUMP that you think would put a hole in the floor then run at super speed through the house (how those little bones stand it, I don\'t know) and she jumps on and off the condo and it stands up to her and even the balls are still attached to the strings. You just have to make sure you screwed everything in tight!\n
\n  I\'ll start off by saying it was a day late shipping to me. Not a big deal, but heads up.<br/><br/>Anyways, this tree is amazing. We have a kitten and we know we need to make a long term investment in a big tree because she will grow out of the smaller ones real quick. This same tree was $260 at Pet Smart. We found it here and honestly expected it to suck. But we tried it and it turned out fantastic. It\'s super easy to assemble and has good instructions. Took me 10 mins tops to finish, and our kitten was playing on it before I even finished building. She loves it.<br/><br/>The perches and cubbie are too big for her obviously, but they look plenty big enough for when she is an adult. She will be comfortable. It\'s really sturdy and the hanging balls are a great add on. She plays with them constantly.<br/><br/>Needless to say, we will be purchasing here again. Great product.\n
\n  We had just rescued a five year old cat, whom they said liked to climb, into a home with two large dogs. We thought she would need a place to get up higher that was preferably not our kitchen counter. I searched online, carefully reading reviews &amp; thought this was a fair price &amp; bet. It turns out THIS WAS PERFECT! It arrived right on time, was in great condition with all parts present, wicked easy to put together (less than 5 min) and of course it came in a box, so all cats &amp; dogs were already interested. It did smell a little like "new" plastic or something, so we put our families dirty clothes on it for a day or two and.....PERFECT! Within a week, all three of our cats climb, scratch, sleep, &amp; play on it. WIN, WIN!<br/><br/>The only downside, is that the top two platforms are a little small for our largest cat (12lbs) she lays there anyway, and loves it, but if it were just a hair bigger, I\'d purchase a second one.\n
\n  Nice looking product - however the two towers screw in by tiny screws and will not fasten down appropriately for a cat or cats(s) jumping up and down off of it. The upper post broke off at the base within two weeks and the other one is quite wobbly and I assume will break in the near future.<br/><br/>This is not intended for cats over 10lbs - as the triangular cubby hole is quite small, as well as the circular \'run through\' hole below that. I bought this on reading several reviews on this being able to hold larger cats - mine are 10bs and 7lbs. This is untrue. Absolute waste of money.<br/><br/>These are pictures of the broken higher tower and how flimsy it is constructed, the lower second tower which came misshapen and the overall result. Do not waste your money. Also, one of the attached \'play balls\' came undone about a week after purchase.<br/><br/>Unless you place this in a corner, this thing has no chance of standing on its\' own. Bad Porduct! Do not buy this.\n
\n  I received the package and assembeled the cat tree in about 20 minutes. There are picture instructions that are VERY easy to follow. No tools required. The cat tree is very sturdy if you make sure to tighten the screws all the way. The carpet fabric is low in quality but is very soft. If your cat is a heavy scratcher I anticipate that the fabric will not last long. My cat is a full grown 8lb cat at 5 years old. The condo space is just the right size for her. If you have a larger cat this is likely not the cat tree for you. What I really like about this cat condo is that the perches have edges and are pillow like. The perches are high enough that my cat can get away from my 70 lb dog ( boxer golden mix) . It is a good condo for the price that I paid. I don\'t anticipate having it last for more than a few years because of the carpet fabric but for the price I am satisfied.\n
\n  Overall this is a really good product. Assembly was very simply and pretty self explanatory even though it did include instructions. I have 2 Maine Coon kittens - one 10lbs and the other 7lbs (both still growing).  For 2 kittens that are really feisty, the base is a little light for larger cats.  Jumping from the top pedestal, the large kitten has managed to tip the unit over a time or 2.  5-stars for a heavier, thicker base.<br/><br/>Also, one of the balls included with the unit was pretty much destroyed on the first day.  This was expected, but not really on the first day.<br/><br/>I would recommend using Loctite when assembling the condo. After a couple of months, somehow the pedestals managed to get kind of wobbly.  This was quickly remedied by twisting each pedestal to tighten the connecting bolts.\n
\n  This is a great tower. I have three cats and they all love it.  The bed is quite large, my 17 pound cat loves it, and the two high top perches are very plush. It is by far the most sturdy and stable tower I have ever bought, and I have bought quite a few over the years. The quality is great, it was fairly easy to put together and looks nice in such a neutral color. My rescue cats don\'t have claws, so I can\'t attest to the durability of it in that regard, but I would bet that it would hold up well. Overall this is a great tower, at a great price, and I would recommend this to anyone who has cats.<br/><br/> Update:<br/><br/> Just rescued an 8 week old kitten and he loves it, especially the toys that dangle down and the round center napping area.  Now all 4 of my cats love it, and it is very sturdy when they start playing on it with each other.\n
\n  I looked at hundreds for the right one that would fit on my small living room.  and finally I decided on this one and was so nervous but its an amazing new place for the kittens to play thats all theirs and they love it.  I have been telling all my friends about it and posted pictures on Facebook.  I hope my cat loving friends get more of these.  If my living room was a little bigger I\'d orden another one.  I\'m thinking of ordering a similar one only a diferent style for my bedroom.  Pet Club packaged this in perfect box and young neighbor had it together in 15 minutes.  Thank You Pet CLUB LLC . If it had not been for your reasonable prices and shipping I would not have been able to afford to get this.  I love it.\n
\n  My cat have had this for a year now.  The top two towers are a little rocky (my cats got kinda fat) but I also think I can tighten the bolts again -- I\'m just lazy.  One of the little balls on a string busted off because of me, though.  They never use that little wavy scratch post or climb into that hoop, but maybe a kitten would.  They do use it as a scratching post though, so that\'s perfect.  They do enjoy sitting on the upper levels as they look out the windows.  My youngest cat likes to do that crazy-run-around-the-house-at-3am thing and bolt up and down this tree.  Overall, my cats love having a piece of furniture they know is truly theirs.\n
\n  We were looking for a scratching post / climbing something for our new kitten who was starting to use our furniture for non-acceptable purposes.  This seemed to be the best bang for the buck when looking the choices.  It was very easy to put together even with the help of the cat. She played with each part as I put it together. Once together it is very sturdy and big.  I am not worried about it tipping over.  The S shaped scratching board does stick out from the base.  I simply turned it to the side so it would not be tripped over. So far she cannot walk past it without jumping on and playing or taking a nap. :)\n
\n  This is a great cat tower because it\'s tall but not TOO tall, and all of the beds/spaces are perfectly large enough for my sort of large cat. If you\'re looking for something that won\'t take up your entire wall, and that won\'t be too small for your not-tiny cat, this is a great choice. I think I assembled it in about 10 minutes or less, and I don\'t notice and issues with sturdiness. Sure, it isn\'t rock-solid, but it isn\'t a noticeable hazard to either me or my cat. It\'s great. I put an additional cat bed on the bottom platform and she loves hanging out down there when she wants to get extra cozy and protected. I definitely recommend this!\n
\n  I enjoy this product. It is extremely easy to put together, probably took me 10 minutes, but I\'m a little bit on the handier side. I thought it might have been made out of cardboard because of the price, but it\'s wooden. It definitely is sized for smaller cats - I have a kitten who loves it. Though she still prefers to claw up the couch instead of her new tower. The balls were a nice touch and she love attacking them. She never has gone into the circular perch on the bottom and has no interest. I think it would be better if you had multiple kittens, they might actually use it. The beds are nice and cushioned, I find her sleeping on the beds often - but sometimes she still prefers our chairs or falls asleep where she lies haha. Overall, I think it\'s a great investment.\n
\n  My cats LOVE this! They sleep/play on this everyday! It is VERY study, which I was concerned about because one of my cats a bit rough when he plays and he is also tall (about 12-13" tall) and long (about 18-19" in length). He has contorted the top bed a little because he is so big and sleeps in it everyday but he has never fallen out of it and seems to still enjoy sleeping in it anyway.<br/><br/>My other kitten is considerably smaller and she runs and climbs up the posts and the other cat chases her and they play on the posts a lot and its still study.<br/><br/>They don\'t really use the "s" shaped thing or the circular tunnel at the bottom very much, but the rest of it they absolutely love.<br/><br/>I would definitely buy this or another kitty condo from this brand!\n
\n  Just got this cat tree today and it is very soft plush and my cat couldn\'t even wait till I got done putting it together to play on it!!<br/>In regards to ease of putting it together: VERY easy to put together. The directions already to follow pictures showing coordinating screws and comes with Allen wrench. I put this together myself in about 10 mins. My cat loves the play balls attracted to the string on the second level and the "house" next to it.<br/>Well made and sturdy. Bottom is wide so it won\'t tip over.<br/>Love the scratch areas on the poles and the "slide".<br/>And the price point makes it an even better deal!!\n
\n  I bought this cat tree on Oct 15, 2016 and received it a couple days later, so shipping was convenient. The tree itself is holding up pretty well my cat uses the scratching posts daily and they are in the same condition as when I received it. I can\'t speak on the bed posts because after spending $60 on the tree my cat being a cat chooses to sleep on the couch instead of the tower. Lastly, I\'m giving four stars because the tower is sturdy, however it will lift/shift slightly when my cat\'s using the scratching posts and because the string the balls are on are thin and my cat broke them playing with them (I think that\'s an easy fix though). Overall I believe it\'s a good purchase.\n
\n  This cat tree is very nice and big,  and our two older kittens love it.  They use it mostly for sleeping in now, but they use it every night.  It is sturdy, well made, and easy to put together. The reason I only gave it three stars is because it smelled horrible and permeated of formaldehyde when we received it.  Formaldehyde is not good for people or cats, and I had hives for two days because I touched it.  I had to put it outside to air out on our patio for a week, and rubbed baking soda into and vacuumed it out.  It was more work than I expected but worth it in the end.\n
\n  What we paid for this was a good price and our cat has been using the scratching posts and the two top beds, so we are really pleased with the Cat Condo. Our cat, however, doesn\'t seem to be interested in balls of any kind, so she doesn\'t play with the dangling balls. The balls have something in the inside that sounds like beads, so they make a sound, but it doesn\'t attract her attention. She also hasn\'t ever touched the "S" curve scratch pad. Maybe your cat(s) will be different, but the dangling balls and scratch pad are basically pointless to our cat.\n
\n  The things that stick up with toys dangling off them are a little cheesy the beds are somewhat small and the sides are soft not rigid. I bought this as a housewarming gift for a friend and her cats love it even the larger 15lb cat enjoys sitting in the beds. It\'s a nice size for their apartment and gives the cats a high viewpoint which is nice for the more shy cats. The top tier is within reach (I can pick up a cat from it and I am 5\'7\'\'). It is a little wobbly but not anything worth concern. It was easy to assemble although the box it came in was heavy.\n
\n  I purchased this for my new kitten, Layla. The assembly was minimal and very easy- all tools required are included. My kitten instantly took to this product- she knows this is an awesome place to hang out, and she does so frequently.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have mentioned that it seemed that the tower was unstable on carpet- I use this on carpet and haven\'t noticed any instability.<br/><br/>Update (11/16/2016): I have to drop this down to 3 stars. The elevated cat beds broke off under the weight of a 13.5lb cat. The shards were fairly sharp, so I am concerned that other cats may get hurt if the bed breaks while unattended.\n
\n  Oh my goodness, the kittens love it.  Recently got 2, 9-week old kittens.  Now at 14 weeks this is their sanctuary/penthouse!  Each has established their own level to sleep and the scratching post is one of their favorites.  Before they used it for the first time I sprayed a bit of catnip on it (lightly) to let them know it was theirs.<br/><br/>It was fairly easy to assemble; I am "directionally challenged" so my husband read instructions and I assembled.  You won\'t go wrong with this "jungle-gym"!\n
\n  If I could give ZERO stars I would ! This is a cheaply made item. My 10 lb cat can\'t even fit in any of the beds without hanging over, the poles are so thin that they have now started to rip out from the wood as I\'ve had to tighten them over and over and now today only about a month old the sticks that hold the play balls has broken off. This is not suitable for anything but possibly a gerbil !!! I\'ll gladly send images of the falling apart unit to anyone who wants to see.\n
\n  Cats love playing on this and it\'s a nice size without being overly large. Only minor downside is that the top \'basket\' is a little wobbly and so my cats aren\'t crazy about sitting in that one unless we put them in it.  The lower basket is used very often though - cats love bird watching from it.\n
\n  Im giving this 4stars because I dont know how it will hold  up over time.  Mine arrived on time. Was nicely packaged. It was very easy to put together. I  had it together in 10 minutes .  Its very sturdy and the material is very soft and plush. It has a strong chemical odor thats given me a bit of a headache and where ive touched it, im itching. But thats most likely my very sensitive skin.<br/>Ill update my review in  few months and see how its  stood up to two very playful kitties.<br/>So far im happy with.\n
\n  We are very pleased with our purchase of this cat condo.  We bought this to replace another cat tree that was given as a gift and after six months of being happily used by two cats, it had finally fallen into disrepair.  We upgraded to this model and with three cats now, we believe we made a great choice.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>*Easy to put together.  I believe one person could do it on their own and with two it was a breeze.<br/>*Overall Durability.  The frame has already taken quite the abuse and is still standing strong.  Every once in a while we need to tighten something, but it is as easy as that.<br/>*Weight. It is durable, but light enough to move to clean or relocate.<br/>*Scratch posts are the perfect texture to attract kitties.  We have cloth furniture and carpet in our home, but it seems that with the multitude of scratching posts available on the condo, the cats just leave our good things alone.<br/>*Price. For our family, the price was very reasonable for what you get.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>*The hanging toys. I gave them two weeks and I was surprised to find that they are lasting longer than that.  They look pretty rough though and it is only a matter of time before we loose all three balls and spokes.  I knew that this would happened and suppose it is indicative of the cats enjoying themselves.  I just wish they were designed a bit sturdier.<br/>*The color.  It shows the dirt.  Badly.  I guess it doesn\'t show the cat hair as bad as something darker, but I am constantly trying to keep it look clean.<br/><br/>Overall it has been a great purchase and we the time comes to replace it, we will definitely look into another Go Pet Club Condo.\n
\n  I like the size and ease of assembly of this tree.  I have 6 cats (I know, it is kind of a problem :-) )  and there is always someone in it.  I wish the beds were larger and the sisal was more robust as I have had to restring almost all the posts with new material.\n
\n  While I like the cat tower overall, I must say that the top level has become wob - I tried unscrewing it and screwing it back in again but that did not fix the problem.  Another thing is the sides of the top 2 levels are soft material, making it hard for a cat to grasp something and climb up...  I like Go Pet Club Towers very much and own another 72" one that is perfect!  Yes, if you have a cat with claws, they will rip the fuzzy carpet off - I just superglue it back on, and VOILA!!..... it\'s all better...\n
\n  This cat tree is awesome. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. I was very picky in choosing one for my cats because they are expensive and cats are picky! I settled with this one and am glad that I did. My cats are 8 and 13 pounds and both use this without any problems. The top beds hold them easily and aren\'t shaky so my cats don\'t get scared. It\'s also high enough so that they can easily lay all day and look out the window. The scratch posts are awesome and have toned down the scratching of my couch! Some reviews have said that the balls are in a weird spot, but my cats love to play with them. My smaller cat stands on the shelf and bats at them and my larger cat bats them from the floor. I\'ve had this almost a year now and it still is in great shape (could almost still pass it as new) and hasn\'t lost any structural integrity. My cats continue to use daily and haven\'t gotten bored with it. I would highly recommend this product. Great value for the price.\n
\n  I am giving this 5 stars for the value. I got mine thru Warehouse deal for under $80 shipped.<br/>It didn\'t have instructions so I pulled up the pic from my order &amp; had it put together in about 30 min.<br/><br/> Now, for descripton. It is made of "fur" not carpet. The "cave" has fur just on the bottom &amp; is not padded. This was the first piece my cat claimed. Just curled up into a ball &amp; disappeared.<br/>Her previous quarters were boxes, that I have FINALLY been allowed to get rid of! Woohoo!<br/><br/>Next, the "bird\'s nest" are nicely padded. The outside has a crunchy plastic inside the fur, good for attracting &amp; keeping a cat\'s attention. It did take her a week to get to the first one but once again, balled up comfortably for a cat nap.  She hasn\'t really discovered the scratching surfaces yet but they are sisal &amp; appear sturdy.<br/><br/> I bought this for 2 reasons. To replace the boxes &amp; give my cat a gym.<br/><br/>She is round. About a kind 15 pounds if you\'re wondering if this can comfortably house a full size cat. She stands &amp; lies on top of the cave to look outside the window<br/><br/> As far as the gym part, well, her condo isn\'t in it\'s permanent spot where she will have more room. I\'ll let you know how it works out when I take down the Christmas tree.\n
\n  I\'ve had this for about a month now.  I bought it for some kittens so granted, they are rather feisty and playful.  The carpeting on this is not good quality.  The post where the three ball toys are is covered in this carpet.  My kittens had it shredded within the first week.  The other upright posts are covered in rope or something that is a lot stronger than that carpet.  It\'s holding up okay.  But, if you buy this, don\'t be surprised to find pieces of carpet all over your floor.  Other then that flaw, I love it and so do the kittens.\n
\n  I got this for about $80 and am okay with the product for that price. The construction is average, but a few holes felt misaligned or shallow/narrow for the screws. Also. it\'s a bit rocky but overall feels more than sturdy for a few cats to use.<br/><br/>Potential buys should be aware that this is designed for medium-sized cats. Larger cats will have a hard time resting comfortably on either pedestal or fitting in the condo (the small hollow tube that hangs beneath the main floor is even too small for medium-sized cats).<br/><br/>If you get this for $70-80, it\'s a serviceable, decent option. Any price that\'s much higher than that, I imagine you\'ll be pretty disappointing and can find better products if you\'re willing to pay more than $80.\n
\n  Rather awkward to assemble, some parts requiring 2 people. The fabric isn\'t designed for the abuse it will be subjected to, particularly with multiple cats. A cat tree is not just a place to lay, cats play around it, climb and scratch it too. Howver, instead of the durable carpet you expect to find on a cat tree, this is a very lightweight "carpet" with an almost velour like finish. I doubt this will hold up for very long at all. The beds/perches aren\'t sturdy at all, more like a floppy hat.\n
\n  I love the products I have bought in the past made by Go Pet Club, and this one is no exception.  I keep coming back because you just can\'t beat the value for the quality.  Easy to assemble (I can do it alone in less than half an hour) and the cats love the variety of perches and surfaces to scratch.  A few have commented on the thinness of the material covering the cat tree.  It is not thick carpet, but it has held up fairly well for my cats.  You may have to invest in a new condo every three years or so, but Go Pet Club products are still a huge value over the competitors.\n
\n  A little disappointed.  I have the Go Pet Club Cat Tree F49  and I love it, that is why I bought this F66.  The F66 is not as sturdy or built as well as the F49.  The posts that hold up the two napping areas are taller than on the F49 but not wider so they wobble.  My cats are 9 &amp; 10 lbs. The little tube under the platform is too short for an adult cat.  They do love the S shaped scratch area.  The corner box on this model (F66) is plenty big enough for the cats.\n
\n  It was to big for the room but we did still use it. I will say that it is wobbly and the one downer is the beds are soft sides so our cats do not like it. Be careful if you want hard sides. This is not the bed for you we did find one that had 3 beds and came almost completely&#8203; put together, It had hard sides and my cats love it in our room. Also the middle of this one is big enough for our fat boy he likes to hide in it.\n
\n  Our cats love the low scratching post-- they don\'t use the S-shaped scratch board at ALL though.  The one loves to sleep up top/high, the other tends to just sleep on the lowest flat level oddly.  Sometimes they go in the little hole to sleep but rarely during the time we are home.  The toy is nice, but the location of the toy is odd and I think the cats dont like having to lay on top of the cave to play with it there.  Good price/function, but the "ergonomics" of it are not great.  But for cost, would prob buy again\n
\n  Kind of small but the price matches the quality and size. Beds are small but will fit a less than 10 lb cat. Poles are thinner than a more expensive condo, but they still do the job as scratchers. I would say this would be for kitten to teen cat size. My 3 and 7 y/o\'s don\'t play with the ball things but they rub their faces on the top of the sticks. Only a kitten would fit in the round tunnel thing at the bottom. Overall, I like it, but for my big cats I still need something alot bigger and most likely more expensive.\n
\n  My cats LOVE the scratching posts, but they\'re torn to shreds. I\'ve had it for a year, and my downside would be that getting replacement posts to scratch (since they tore it up) is not something I\'ve been able to do. Once they\'re gone, I\'m either going to have to manually replace the string or buy a whole new cat house for my two kits. With this, my cats do not use the middle whole or the top beds. The one loves to climb, but he refuses because they\'re flimsy. Good for a kitten, not a fully grown cat.\n
\n  My cats love this thing. Putting it together was a little bit of a challenge. It\'s not too sturdy and one of the beds broke off, the stick toys are about to also but my cats are very rough on it and like to wrestle on the top beds and jump on the stick toys so I dont fully blame the makers of the house for the broken pieces. One of my cats only has 1 front leg and this house isnt too tall or very hard for him to jump/climb on so I recommend this to disabled cat owners\n
\n  I looked forward to getting this for my cat. I have purchased one from this company before and was pleased with it. But she tore the scratchers up so much, it was time for a new one. I like the color and size. I did not have trouble with assembling and everything I needed was in the box. Nothing broke while putting together and it\'s sturdy. My issue was shipping. It said I\'d get it Friday. I didn\'t get it until Tuesday the following week.\n
\n  The top pedestal posts are a bit wobbly (even with constant tightening) and could be more secure.  The three hanging balls did not last a week - the strings came off of the plastic ball and subsequently on two the whole ball and rope came off - and it\'s 4 month old 3 pound or less kitten going to town on them.  In addition, where the toy poles attach to the post, there are sharp pieces of metal that stick out that need to be snipped or pounded over.  I was leery about the material used to cover the \'\'tree\' but thus far it has been easy to clean and hasn\'t worn.  It\'s been a good deal so far.\n
\n  High quality product which would cost $200 or more at a Pet Shop. My cat wouldn\'t go near it for the first few weeks until someone suggested that I place cat treats on the different levels.  I did so and when I came home that evening the treats were gone. From that day on he uses it all the time. I have it in a corner by a window and he loves to sit on it and look out the window. He also uses it as an escape when he is tired of my dogs. Lol\n
\n  I have 2 male cats that are not dainty in any way. They are both about 10-13 pounds and roughhouse together a lot. This is not the condo for them by any means.  We put it together, it was fast and easy.  They can\'t get on top because they are too large, and almost too large to fit in the whole. The round perches are smaller than I thought they would be and the extra plush on them leave little room, just too small for my guys.  I do, however recommend it for smaller cats...say 5-9 pounds. Could be good for up to 2 small cats.  Please secure the base. It isn\'t a very heavy duty condo.\n
\n  The first elevated cat bed fell off after 3 months - the second one just broke today, after only 8 months.  Cheaply constructed, and the covering is thin, poor quality.  It seemed steady at first, but though the cat beds were tightened, they became loose quickly due to the bottom becoming stripped out.  The cats are not huge - one is 10 lb, one is 7.  Very disappointed this didn\'t last longer.\n
\n  I did a lot of research on cat trees before I finally decided on this one. I\'m so happy with my decision and<br/>so are our cats. We have two strays we adopted and the mama cat whose name is Mama (what a coincidence,<br/>right?) and her son love this "condo" Mama sits in the highest part and Oliver sleeps in the lower one. They don\'t<br/>use the kind of S shaped thing but some cats might. It is very sturdy and looks very nice.\n
\n  This is a great cat tree with cat house!  It is well made, sturdy, and nice looking.  I have a 12 pound adult kitty and she loves it.  She takes daily naps in the house.  She loves the hanging "balls"....she batts at them every night.  I will say the two tall "bed" levels are a bit too small for her. She will jump up on them....but she will not lay down.  All in all I recommend this unit!\n
\n  I got this scratching post for my two new kittens and they LOVE it!  They were about 1 month old when I got them from their shelter and immanently they loved it.  They love the 3 hanging balls to play with and they also love to play with each other, one inside of the hole and one outside.  The beds up at the top are very comfortable and one of them sleeps there every night (well almost every night).  I fell that they have decreased the amount of scratching that they do on the furniture due to the many well placed scratching surfaces on the arrangement.  I would recommend this to anyone and I feel that the money was very well spent.\n
\n  My 5 month old kitten LOVES this cat tree.  She loves to lay and play on it, and I think even as she grows it will still be a good size for her.  It was packaged well when it arrived, and although it took some time to assemble, I found it overall to be pretty easy.  Just make sure your vacuum is handy - you\'ll have lots of little carpet pieces on your floor.  I would recommend vacuuming the cat tree once its assembled.\n
\n  This was exactly as expected, and really easy to put together! My kitten likes to play with the balls (they have little noise makers in 2 of them), sleep on the lower pedestal, and scratch around on it. I don\'t think she likes the little circle thing on the underside of the structure, the closed space, or the higher pedestal, and I\'ve never seen her scratch on the scratching posts (although she scratches on the carpeted parts).\n
\n  Bought this nearly a year ago.<br/><br/>Atheistically - it has not held up well.  The purpose of a cat tree is multiple places for kitty to scratch,  All the jute trimmings are frayed and in shambles.  Very messy.  Disappointed and tired of restringing pieces of jute.<br/><br/>Structurally - it is sound.  Never been knocked over by 4 energetic 1 year old kitties.\n
\n  If I were able to rate this a zero, I would! This is a piece of junk. I ordered this on June 3rd and both beds are already broken. My cat is not a huge cat, so there is no excuse for this to be broken. The lower bed broke first and then the second bed broke. The unfortunate thing was that my cat was on the second bed when it fell to the ground. Now she is terrified of this piece of crap. $75 wasted in one month.\n
\n  Caboose loves his cat tree. I live in a small apartment, so there\'s not much room for my active little kitty to run around.  I spent a long time looking around for a cat tree that had more for a cat to do than lay around on, and this ended up being the perfect choice.  The scratching posts, ball toys, and interesting climbing options give him all sorts of ways to jump about when he\'s feeling antsy.  The balls are not flimsy, and are on stretchy (but very sturdy) strings.  I don\'t think Caboose will be able to chew through the strings, and despite his interest in phone charging cables etc. seems uninterested in destroying his toy.  The balls are covered in scratching post material, so he can hang on to them and Tarzan himself off the tree.<br/><br/>Even in my small apartment this tree looks great.  The color is nice, and all the fun pieces of it make it less of an eyesore than most cat trees.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Attractive<br/>- Very sturdy (doesn\'t even shake when Caboose jumps directly to the second tier, or when he hangs off the ball stick toys.<br/>- Easy setup.  Took about 10 minutes total and required very little instruction-reading.<br/>- No shedding problem (~3 months so far).  The cat tree is covered in a fake fur type stuff that\'s really soft and doesn\'t shed.<br/>- Cat loves it<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Really none I can think of, though sometimes I\'m afraid caboose will hurt himself because he plays with this so vigorously!\n
\n  This cat condo is perfect. I bought it for 2 kittens I have, they are only 2 lbs each so they are very small but they already love it. It feels very sturdy and I don\'t think it could possibly tilt over even with a very large cat on it. It was easy to put together, I had it assembled and ready to go in 5-10 minutes. The cats love the toy balls and play with them constantly.\n
\n  Very nice condo for cats! Love the color, nice soft and plush. Very easy to assemble within 20 minutes. Condo area nice and roomy for  my large cat~she loves it!\n
