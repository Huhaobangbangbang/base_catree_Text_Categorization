  &#160;Two of my cats loved to climb my old scratching post and attempt to sit atop.  I saw a photo of my friends cat on this scratcher and I asked her where in the world she found it and bought it for myself.  It\'s super tall - if I stand next to it and my cat is sitting on top, my cat is almost as tall as me and I\'m 5\'4!  It gives them lots of scratching room to stretch out, to climb, to stand on top and it\'s super thick around and very sturdy.  Seriously, this is the best scratching post you could ever find and if you\'re in need of one for your cats - get it.  Get it now!  Video attached of my silly cat chasing his tail on top of the scratcher.
  I ordered this scratching post because I have a large cat and wanted something durable. It had great reviews and others commented it was great for big cats- perfect, I ordered it. Two days later it was here and I literally laughed as I put it together. Assembly was easy and the product is sturdy...... but it is HUGE. Laughable huge. Good product, I would absolutely recommend. Just be aware that it\'s massive. I included a picture for scale. &#128514;
  &#160;My kitty is having so much fun on this cat tree! She loves the Pom Pom the best. I\'m worried she will wear it out soon! It\'s is very sturdy and hasn\'t wobbled at all when she jumps on and off of it. The fabric is thick and she scratches the canvas as well as the scratch area. Assembly was very simple as well.  The color had tans and beige and isn\'t just black and white like the photo shown but it is very pretty in person and looks much more expensive than it was. The round bed piece is nicely padded inside for extra kitty comfort too. Great buy &amp; happy entertained cat!
  If you want happy, magical kitties, then buy this! This purchase was made based on height. The larger towers seem a hazard to me, especially with two active kitties. This is the perfect height! I am also able to move it around the house more easily then the traditional tower style. Our cats love to spring up on the platform, or into the tunnel. They enjoy laxing on this as well as they watch us go about. They bat at each other and the fluff ball that hangs nearby. They love to scratch their nails on it as well. The material has exceeded my expectation and does not leave any carpet fibers or fuzz behind for my kitties to be naughty and chomp on. Great play design for all magical kitties!!
  It took my cats a while to warm up to this scratching post. Perhaps they were intimidated by the sheer size of it; the thing is absolutely massive. For the first month they more or less ignored it, and it simply took up space -- a lot of space, did I mention it was massive? -- in my upstairs hallway. Then they started using it, a few scratches here, a few scratches there. Now it gets use multiple times a day for a bit of good scratching time. The younger, spryer cat likes to scale it with her claws and then perch atop it, like an Egyptian princess. And they do seem to appreciate the ability to get a good stretch in while using it. So, all in all, a good purchase.<br/><br/>NINE MONTH UPDATE: After nine months the cats are still loving this. I have it in a hallway they pass through a lot and they are always stopping to get a good scratch in. The small cat still loves to scale it and perch atop. Great addition to the house!<br/><br/>TWO YEAR UPDATE: The older cat (who isn\'t all that old but is lazy) is no longer interested in this post. There are a lot of scratching posts in the house and there is another, smaller set of posts that are part of a climbing multi-platform tree that he prefers. But the younger cat (now about 3-4 years old) still loves it and plays with it all the time! She still enjoys scaling it like she\'s climbing a tree, and perches gargoyle-like atop it. And it\'s held up very well over the years.
  My Mainecoons love this scratching post.  Nice to have something big enough for them.  My photo shows our old store bought scratcher next to this one<br/>Update: after 5 years it&#8217;s seen better days but still holding strong and the cats still love it
  I just received this cat tree and set it up in less than 5 minutes.  Overall it seems sturdy, it might be a tiny bit wobbly though.  I&#8217;m not sure how it will hold up over time but I really love the wicker details and for the price this is one of the best options I&#8217;ve found.  Most of these style cat trees are over $100 and this one was around $75 at the time I purchased it.  I would definitely purchase another cat tree made by this company in the future.<br/><br/> There are 3 main pieces you have to screw together and then the 2 beds that are separate pieces.  I appreciate being able to remove the cushions since cat hair can collect, and it&#8217;s so hard to clean off the other style that are more like carpet.  This style allows you to use your own bed if you want and easily wash the bedding.<br/><br/>My cats love it already and these two usually can&#8217;t stand being near each other.  I&#8217;ll update this review if I have any issues over the next couple months.
  Don\'t put this anywhere near water.  Don\'t purchase if your cats pee on things - destroys the product and voids the warranty.<br/><br/>Core of scratching post (the structural element) is made of pressboard (pressed recycled paper), which turns to mush when wet or even damp.<br/><br/>Cats peed on the bottom part of the post, which then disintegrated and broke off.  (Luckily none of the cats was hurt.  The interior of the bottom part of the post, underneath the faux fur cover, is made of ""pressboard" - recycled paper strips pressed together.  Once wet, it became mushy and fell apart.)<br/><br/>Bought this 2 months ago.  $45 for 2 months use is not good value.  Sad.  :(<br/>Until it crumbled, this post was great - cats loved it (, and apparently MARKED it), and used it until it fell.<br/><br/>Re:  the "one-year warranty":  Called &amp; was told it probably would not cover this, because my cats peed on the post.  Okay.  But cats often pee on things.  The consumer expects a cat toy to withstand cat pee, as well as scratching &amp; climbing.<br/><br/>(This is comparable to a baby toy manufacturer saying it has no responsibility for what happens if a baby puts the toy in its mouth or does any of the other things babies universally do.)<br/><br/>Mfr\'s rep told me I am welcome to send in photos, with a my product number and a copy of my receipt, and MAYBE they will do something for me - but probably not.  That\'s a lot of trouble when I\'ve already been told the cat pee basically voids the warranty.  (I mean, who would ever think a cat would pee on its toy?  Other than most cat owners....)
  Ideally, I\'d subtract one-half star because the unit is a bit wobbly by design.  The base is the same size as the two platforms above it; perhaps if it was a bit bigger it would provide more of a solid foundation.  I placed it next to a wall for more stability.  Once my cats got used to the slight movement as they jumped onto it, it was fine.  They use each of the levels and even my 19 lb. thug of a cat likes to squeeze himself into the hideout on the bottom.  Assembly was a breeze, requiring only a screwdriver (allen wrench is included).  There are a couple of plastic caps to cover the two exposed screw heads.  These kept coming off so I glued them on, solving the problem.  The black portions are a plush fabric and vacuum easily.  The biggest selling point for me was the fact that this isn\'t just another ugly piece of cat furniture - it actually looks great!  Perfect for small to medium-sized cats...okay for bigger cats who think they are small.
  I have seen numerous reviews whining that the double-ended screw for putting the top basket\'s post onto the platform below is "too short". But it isn\'t! The only thing wrong is the instructions. They say to get a flat head screwdriver and tighten the bolt in all the way, then attach the post. It won\'t work to do that. What I did was screw it down into the platform just enough for it to get a firm grip, then I threaded the post on and there was enough bolt sticking up that the post could grip the bolt too. Then by turning the post, both ends of the bolt tightened in as far as they could sucking the post down firmly onto the platform. No screwdriver needed and certainly no trip to the hardware store or call to the manufacturer trying to obtain a similar but longer bolt.<br/><br/>What else can I report on? Of course I do wish there was an option to have plain fabric rather than this tacky stuff, but maybe some day I will recover it. And though a question asking if the posts were solid wood got the reply that they are, causing me to choose this over one half the price that had cardboard tubes with plastic end caps- this indeed has cardboard tubes with plastic end caps. So I am pretty bummed I splurged for the expensive tower and got low quality anyway. The shelves are also cardboard so there\'s that formaldehyde stink but we painted the exposed part with sealant. Nothing we can do about the fumes coming out through the fabric except keep the window next to the tower open for as long as we can until winter forces us to close it. At least it is less stinky than a carpet covered tower. The baskets seem to have a real wood bottom which is maybe what I saw in a pic that had me thinking the whole thing was made of real wood. Naw, it\'s your standard cheap, nasty cat tower. So don\'t get your hopes up.<br/><br/>The good thing about it is that it seems heavy enough to not tip over, unlike the Armarkat one I got years back, that my 6-pound kitten keeps toppling. And the glue used doesn\'t offgas, like that brand. This is at least better than those!<br/><br/>And the baskets are cute of course. The cushions for in them are way too thin so I plan to open them up and add some stuffing once I get around to it.<br/><br/>Keep in mind the center of the top basket is quite offset from the center of the base so if you want to squeeze this around a night stand or other obstruction that can be a useful strategic detail. or if you forget and plan on it being straight up you might end up frustrated.
  This cat tree was pretty easy to assemble.  My 10 year old daughter helped me put it together in about 20 minutes.  I got everything tightened up and it\'s pretty sturdy.  It does have a little wobble when my cat goes on the higher platform.  I feel like that\'s to be expected with something this tall being jumped on by a fairly large, adult cat.  He\'s a cautious cat and it doesn\'t seem to bother him.<br/><br/>It took about a day before my cat fell in love with this cat tree.  He\'s formerly feral so at first I think he wasn\'t quite sure what it was.  My cat is pretty big.  I think he may be part Norwegian forest cat. He\'s quite long and about 14 lbs now.  He refuses to go in the top cat cave thing or the hammock.  He loves the platforms, scratching posts, and sleeping on the bottom.  The scratching posts are tall enough that he can stretch to scratch. He fits comfortably on the platforms.  He used to meow at me constantly to sit on the ottoman with him on my lap so he could see out the window.  He\'s a lot less whiney now that he has his own seat by the window.  It was worth the money.  I spent a lot of time looking for a cat tree.  I\'m glad that I chose this one.
  I have been looking for a tall scratching post for my 2 cats. I read the positive reviews about this one and decided to give it a try. It does not disappoint! It easily assembles in less than 5 minutes and is sturdy as can be. It really is pretty tall although I would purchase an even taller model if I could find one! It has a large sturdy base and is very well made. My cats love to scratch and climb a the way to the top. I\'ve found that it sheds some "particles" after a week or so of use but it\'s minimal not an issue. I vacuum the base and it\'s good to go. Would def purchase again!
  My cat enjoys this and so does my sister\'s!  He can actually reach up to his full height and scratch, not like the other posts on my cat tree where he can be lazy and scratch while sitting.  He\'s only 9 lbs, so not, in my perspective, a big cat.  I like that it\'s very easy to put up and take down.  There are only like seven pieces, the bottom, the two parts of scratching post, a middle partition, and the screws and stuff to put it together.  Very simple!<br/><br/>The first time I brought this home (I\'m a college kid) my sister\'s cat and mine were climbing on it.  They were racing each other to the top!  They were reenacting that fateful scene where Scar throws Mufasa from the cliff to his doom!  So not only is this a good scratching post, it\'s a good climbing post too.  Sometimes one of them just sits on top.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this.  This is great and is sturdy.  I don\'t have to weigh the bottom down either, and it doesn\'t shake much/at all when they jump and play on it!
  This is hands down the best cat scratching post I\'ve ever purchased, and I\'ve tried quite a few. Descriptions and reviews always tell you how sturdy they are, and yet my cat, who weighs 13 lbs., would easily knock them all over. I\'ve even had to fill the (hollow) posts with rocks to keep them standing. This post is very easy to assemble. The base is sturdy and reliable, and the post itself is 6" in diameter. My cat can actually sit on top of it, which he loves doing. It\'s by far the sturdiest and heaviest post I\'ve ever purchased. I didn\'t have to do a thing to it except assemble it. No rocks needed. No matter how fast he comes at it or jumps on it, it stays put. I highly recommend this post. My cat loves it. Plus, it\'s tall. He is able to get a full stretch while scratching, which is what cats need. I\'m actually going to order a second one since we both love this one so much. Highly recommended!!
  I\'ve been looking for a scratching post like this my whole life except I had no idea such a one actually existed!<br/>When I got home tonight my husband had already put it(Them, actually, because I bought two) together. He said it was easy and they seemed to be as stable as I had said they should be according to comments. When I looked at them I was both shocked and delighted because they were bigger than I ever anticipated. My husband asked me if I was planning on adopting a Bobcat! &#129315;<br/>But, the cats are already scratching and playing on them. Hopefully, between these awesome, cat approved, scratching posts and the \'sticky paws\' double sided tape panels I\'ve put on the sofa, cupboards and walls, we can get the cats to leave the furniture and cupboards alone so we can do some remodeling!<br/>These really are awesome and seem as if they will remain sturdy. I would say these are WELL worth the money!!!<br/>And these days there are not many things you\'ll hear me rave about like these.
  Got big cats?  Then this is the scratching post for you!  For those who aren\'t handy or can\'t be bothered to get handy, this scratcher is the total bomb for Maine Coons, Weegies and any \'ol gigantic cat.  It\'s so totally awesome that we\'re glad we ordered 2 for our giant Weegies.  We\'re thinking that we\'ll order a couple more because the great stuff for big cats tends to vanish just when it\'s time to re-stock.<br/><br/>Assembly is simple and fast.  Everything needed to screw the pieces together is included - 1 allen wrench, 1 washer, 1 bolt and 1 connecting bolt.  It took less than 3 minutes to put it together.  Really.  Our smallest scruffy cat is already swinging from the heights!<br/><br/>It really is 41" tall and 6" in diameter.  The base is heavy, 19" square and supports the height correctly.  Because the big cats stand on the base to scratch, it won\'t fall over.<br/><br/>All in all, we have a winner!  Thank you Midwest Homes for remembering the big guys.<br/><br/>Update:  These are the favorite scratching posts in the house.  Even our scruffy mini cat (13 lbs) tears it up on this scratcher.  He climbs to the top and then launches himself on the table or into space.  Our gigantic Weegies can stretch full length for the first time ever while scratching.  The 1/4" sisal looks as if it will last for a while even with the heavy use.  So, we ordered 2 more as back-ups.
  I\'ve had the first post at least since 2016, maybe even earlier, &amp; it has held up very well though many cats, including my 2018 yellow-kitty rescue, a mama &amp; litter of kittens I rescued &amp; fostered in 2020 -- the white (initially-feral-now-my-baby) mama of the litter I rescued still climbs up &amp; perches on top!  As per the photos, the top portion was getting shaggy. I was finding large clumps of sisal around it each day, &amp; feared they might ingest it.<br/>As my kitties scratched on the bottom section, the top was pretty much unused -- so, I simply removed the bottom section to throw away, then used the top section to become the now-shorter post!  As you can see, one of my kitties used it even before I could move it into the other room, where it\'ll now stay!<br/>This post is so sturdy -- no complaints from me or my kitties!
  I avoided buying a scratching post from a pet store as they were too short and didn\'t seem sturdy enough. This post is just short of 4\' high, about 4" in diameter and attached to a base that prevents tipping even when the kitty gets aggressive. It\'s sturdy enough and doesn\'t take up as much space compared to other options out there.<br/><br/>So far, it\'s a great deal for about $40 compared to what was available in the stores. If it doesn\'t stand the test of time - or kitty\'s claws - I will update my review.
  Took me 20 minutes to assemble but I was deliberate and cautious and could probably put together in 10 minutes.  Box was about 47 pounds and the package was well arranged and secure.  There were no missing pieces or damaged items.  I was able to securely tighten all columns without threat of stripping threads.  No need for screwdriver or tools although they recommend flathead.  This is made in China which does not bother me the slightest because it is so well made.  I think the rope could be better quality but that is it.  I love this so much I may buy these little squirts another one.
  My cat did not like this at first until I took it apart. I used the bed somewhere else and removed the post holding it up. Also removed the hammock which she had no use for. Now she loves to sit on it and look out the window.<br/>A big NO NO NO to putting carpeting on the sisal rope sections. Carpet pieces get stuck in her claws almost daily when she scratches on them and I have concern she could swallow the pieces if I don\'t yank them out of her claws first (challenging to say the least).<br/>While this is pleasing to look at for the cat owner, the carpet on the sisal sections (which I am assuming is not digestible and has chemicals) is a BAD IDEA. Is it there for looks or because it\'s cheaper than sisal rope?<br/>Pet product companies need think of the safety of the cats that are using their products..
  We moved to a new house and catten was starting to claw the furniture (something he\'s never done). It took a sec to realize he didn\'t have his trusted cat tree in the living room. Since one was in his room and the other in the loft, we needed a scratcher. I was hesitant to get another tree, especially since the sisal is so thin he takes it out in a couple of months.<br/><br/>But this scratcher has nice thick rope. It has taken to his scratching well. Catten diverted his attention immediately when this was put in the living room, saving our less than year old La-Z-Boy chairs. It\'s sturdy enough to handle his weight, though he doesn\'t jump to the top, just stands and scratches as high as he can reach.
  I ordered the cat tower in Black and I am very happy with it. It is not your typical cardboard and pressed board construction. I did not think I would describe a cat tower as pretty, but it is. It looks like a piece of furniture. Do not be put off by the small footprint, it\'s sturdy construction allows for this. My cat jumps on and off it with abandon and it barely moves at all. It is hard to find a dark tower for a black cat. This has soft fur and a pretty black and white print. I think it will hold up much longer than my prior towers.  It is easily assembled but follow instructions carefully as some of the hardware can be inserted in wrong spots if not careful. My cat loves the curl-up spot on top and the height, it is about 50" tall. If the style works for your cat, have no doubt about it, I think you\'ll love it as much as Poe an I do.
  We recently adopted 3 litter-mate kittens from a rescue shelter.  They love the tower, and our furniture loves the fact that the tower has all those scratching posts.  Often multiple kittens are playing or sleeping on the tower at the same time.  It is very easy to put together (just need to use the provided allen wrench on a few bolts), and has good instructions.  It took me about 15 minutes on my own to put it together.<br/><br/>The kittens don\'t play with the balls on strings very much, but that they may be because they have plenty of toys.  When they jump on the top seat, that particular pole wiggles a bit, but the kittens don\'t mind at all.  They jump up there without hesitation, and even though the seat doesn\'t look that big, there are often two cats on the top seat.  Sometimes, they even play/fight with each other both on the top seat, and with one on the top seat, and one on the section below.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the kittens give it 3 paws up!!
  &#160;We have two bengals, and needed an alternate climbing option beyond their cat tree.  We wanted something tall and sturdy and this is one of the best affordable, non-custom options available.  We actually have two of these &#8212; one at our home and one at the in-law&#8217;s for when the cats travel there with us.<br/>When we bought the second one, we realized something taller (more challenging) would be even better, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to exist on the market.  As an experiment, we took one of the &#8220;pole&#8221; lengths from another unit and added it (so that there are 3 rather than 2 lengths of pole).  This modification seems to work well &#8212; our cats enjoy the extra height (as you can see from the photo).  Either way &#8212; if you use it as-is or modify it to be one length taller &#8212; it&#8217;s a good scratcher option.  The only reason we&#8217;re not giving 5 stars is that we wish they: (1) offered other color options for the furry fabric and (2) offered an extension piece to make it taller (so you don&#8217;t have to pull from another unit).
  My cat Bugsy had totally shredded the fabric on a La-Z-Boy recliner. I replaced it with a leather one that both rocks and swivels -- cats don\'t usually like the feel of smooth leather or objects that move when they scratch. Instead I got this HUGE 41", 6" diameter cat scratcher that looks like a mini-cannon -- and he LOVES it! He doesn\'t even scratch the one other chair he used to bother anymore!<br/><br/>The best part of all this is -- I no longer am screaming at my wonderful Bugsy which I did every time I heard his nails ripping on the chair and our house is now peaceful and loving. The pictures show Bugsy sitting on the base of the scratcher (which I also treat with catnip/catnip spray) and the poor chair I had to throw out.
  Three cats have given this condo a try: an 8 month old, 1.5 year old. and an 18 year old. The older cats did not like using the lowest level as a step up, because the wicker sides are higher than the thin pillow inside. I padded this and the top level basket with towels to fix this issue, but only the kitten approved. She takes a running start at the cat tree and shoots up to the top level like a maniac and the structure stays stable. She only weighs 5 pounds, but she gets up a head of steam.<br/>The senior cat thought the platforms were not padded enough and wasn\'t comfortable getting from level to level, but she was pretty sick when she used this condo. The 1.5 yo cat doesn\'t really like cat condos at all, but she did enjoy the wicker igloo. The kitten immediately loosened the plastic screw cover on the penultimate level and I took it from her before she swallowed it. She likes to pull herself around on the ground using the 4 pillars. The rattan and sissal parts of the cat condo still look good, but I\'ve only had the kitten for a week and I\'m sure they will be shredded soon. Better that than my furniture.
  I have a 16-pound cat who doesn&#8217;t really understand how strong and big he is. So he tends to break a lot of his toys and cat furniture. I&#8217;ve tried other &#8220;jumbo&#8221; or &#8220;huge&#8221; cat scratching posts and they only last for a few months. He&#8217;s also pretty tall so when he stretched out to scratch, he would tip over the other scratching posts. When this one arrived, I was slightly overwhelmed by how massive it was. You should be warned that it&#8217;s huge so it definitely stands out in a room. Important thing though is that my big cat LOVES it. The first time he used the scratching post, he kept scratching for a good 5 minutes and he was finally able to stretch his entire body.<br/><br/>Only downside, this post smells really bad. I&#8217;d say it has this awful dirty socks kind of smell to it. I&#8217;ve had it for a few weeks now but the smell hasn&#8217;t completely aired out. If I walk past it and get a whiff, I get self conscious for no reason.
  &#160;I have purchased many cat towers and scratching posts in my time and this is by far one of the best. My sister got my Mom a kitten for her birthday and we convinced her not to declaw. She didn&#8217;t want to get a cat tree, so I went on a hunt to find a stand-alone scratcher. My requirements were that it should be tall enough for an adult-sized cat to stretch out fully when using it, that it have sisal (and enough of it for the cat to scale the whole post), and that it be solid and sturdy so it would remain upright. This scratching post exceeded my expectations and it was super easy to assemble. And for what you get, the price is very reasonable. I liked it so much that I am going to order another for my 2 adult cats!
  With 3 kittens and 2 cats, scratching posts get moved around and even shredded at times. This post is taller than most of the posts in my house and much thicker around then any of the posts in my house. The kittens will stop halfway up and realize they can use their back claws as well as front to climb the post and will sit there for a few minutes using all four claws until they start playing king of the hill and trying to knock each other off and gain the top of the post. When the kittens are done, the adults stretch to fully extend themselves as they scratch the post. Sometimes they will act like they are climbing a tree as they move up the post. So far only 3 have been on it at one time, but it has held them without any swaying and they weigh from 7 pounds to 12 pounds each.
  This is one big scratcher!  I wouldn\'t call it indistructable, but it\'s probably indistructable to a house cat.  Exceeds the quality expectation, especially for the price.  Lot\'s of value for a quality product here, very sturdy for a cat\'s weight.  Kuzya scratches it like a tiger then perches on the top to watch over his domain!
  I bought this for my rather large Maine coon because he was scratching the rug, furniture--anything he could get his claws on.  I prefer a carpeted base to one with hard wood.  When I put this up, he loved it immediately and he has stopped scratching everything else which is amazing.  This post is VERY big and tall (and heavy) but what I like is that it has a carpeted base and is extremely sturdy--it will not tip over no matter how much the cat pulls on it (he weighs 15 lbs and is very strong).  The cat will climb to the top when I tempt him with a toy so it\'s good exercise.  He also uses it to stretch.  The sisal is one of the best materials--cats really like it.  Only time will tell how long it lasts.  It was easy to assemble.  I\'ve had many scratching posts through the years and so far, this one checks all the boxes.
  This is a great product and totally worth the buy. Small scratching posts are always either really flimsy and easily destroyed by cats or they&#8217;re really expensive. This post is huge and sturdy and it&#8217;s massive. It&#8217;s like a tree. Well worth the cost compared to any other scratching post. Great if you have large cats. My cats both love it and the smaller cat actually jumps up and climbs on it and hangs off the side with her claws. The big cat is really tall and he will stand up on his back feet and stretch his front legs all the way up as high as he can reach when he scratches it. This is a cat who will stand up on his back legs to grab things off the kitchen counter with his paws instead of jumping up onto the counter if that gives you an idea how tall he is. So glad I bought this.
  I love the length and circumference of this cat post. It&#8217;s extra tall and the cats really love stretching out when they scratch on the post. All four cats use it throughout the day. I purchased this so I could deter one of my cats started scratching on the door frames! Although Pearl hasn&#8217;t stop scratching the door frames completely, this post helps her scratch less! The cats make scratching on the post a game. It&#8217;s very cute watching them, and it make me feel like it was money worth spending! I definitely recommend this super big cat scratching post! Great investment on my part!
  As those of us who shop on Amazon frequently know, there is a significant savings in buying open boxed or gently used products. So when I saw this cat tree for 50% off, I decided to chance it. Well the reason people returned the product was that they had been sent the wrong hardware LOL so I cannibalized an old cat tree and was able to put it together.<br/><br/>All I can say is it\'s really cute and seems to be quite stable as it has a weighted base. I\'m getting a litter of kittens to Foster so I needed something that they could crawl all over and hopefully they\'ll like it.<br/><br/>Had the correct hardware been included, it would have taken 2 minutes to put together &amp; received five stars.
  I knew this scratcher would be big, but I didn&#8217;t realize just HOW big until it was out of the box and set up! Not only is it tall, but it&#8217;s a large tube too, and an extremely sturdy base! My 12 pound gals have jumped up on it and climbed to the top and there was no worry about it falling over! The words I keep using to describe the scratcher are &#8220;sturdy&#8221; and &#8220;hefty&#8221;.<br/><br/>I thought the cat in the advertised picture was just another badly scaled photoshop job, but honestly it&#8217;s not far off! I&#8217;m including a photo comparing the size of this scratcher to another popular (and also sturdy!) scratcher. Both scratchers are great and the cats are happily using both, but if you have a long or big kitty, you might want to consider this scratcher so they can stretch to their full length!<br/><br/>Last note, it&#8217;s very easy to assemble.
  Can\'t say enough good things about this cat tree!!  It\'s sturdy, easy to assemble and made of better quality materials than anything we had had before or seen.  Our 5 cats love it:  the multiple levels are well designed for play; they especially like the 4th level that has a "hole" and allows them to play paw at each other.  The top perch is well used by our height-seeking cats.  The cubby is snuggly for naps.  We have had numerous guests comment on how nice the unit is with great looking upholstery that enhances our rooms.  We liked this so much we also orderd 3 other models in the same pattern/design: The Salvador, The Escapade, and most recently, The Carnival.  Each is well liked by our cats and kittens and look great in the rooms they are in!
  Just set this up, so if anything changes I&#8217;ll update the review. But my cats LOVE this thing!<br/><br/>Pros: Our 2 cats are obsessed!!  very sturdy, nice thick material and padding- seems very plush, I was actually really surprised with how nice the material is. You can reattach the little puff balls or add other items on, unlike some items once they pull the toy off you can&#8217;t tie it back on. Great price and pretty great quality (time will tell how well it holds up! But it seems like it will for a long time). No plastic waste! Everything wasn&#8217;t wrapped and tied in a bunch of waste<br/><br/>Neutral/Cons: the instructions could have been a little more helpful but overall not super complicated, it came in a cardboard box with all the individual pieces just placed in the box, so on arrival the box was partially ripped open and I was worried some of the smaller parts could have fallen out, luckily they were all there. But maybe in the future the company could attach the screws/bolts to one of the larger items. Also the 3rd tier didn&#8217;t have the hole cut out of the fabric so we had to cut it ourselves
  This is the largest cat scratching post I have ever seen. If you looking for a sturdy post your cat will love this is the one.  Our Eddie is on the smaller side at 9 lbs but he really enjoys a full stretch that those short posts can&#8217;t provide. Cats need and enjoy a post that allows them to reach and extend their body. This post has a one piece base that bolts to the base of the post and is not going to fall over. Well made and heavy duty and should last for years. Be prepared this post is massive but is made like furniture and looks great. It&#8217;s pricey but if it saves your sofa from destruction, it&#8217;s a bargain!
  We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this item. The designs on the fabric are brocade and it looks high-quality and unique. We searched stores prior to taking the risk of buying online, and this is far more beautiful than anything we saw at the pet stores.<br/>2 concerns: The plastic covers meant to cover the bolts on the horizontal pieces (where the cat sits) do not fit and slide off with even the slightest movement. Therefore, the bolts in the middle of two tiers will be exposed to the cat. No problems with this safety-wise that I can find however.<br/>Secondly, for large cats the topmost tier might be too small. I think this will fit most adult cats, but not a cat like a Maine Coon- just something to be aware of if your cat is particularly large.
  I knew this was going to be a large cat scratching post, but I never expected it to be as big as it is&#8212; it is HUGE! &#128563;(You can see how tiny my &#8220;plump&#8221; 13.5 pound kitty looks laying next to it.) It is extremely well made, sturdy, and durable, and the sisal scratching post is super thick. It really is something! This scratching post would be ideal for multi-cat households, for sure. I&#8217;ve always just ordered regular scratching posts before and they&#8217;ve always had to be replaced after a while, so I decided to spend a little bit more for better quality, and I&#8217;m glad I did, because I don&#8217;t foresee having to replace this one for YEARS! Of course, only time will tell, though. I have two 9-year old cats, and at first, I don&#8217;t think they quite knew what to make of it, but they eventually figured it out. The carpet on the bottom is super soft, and my one kitty loves laying on it. As long as you don&#8217;t mind a very tall and large scratching post, I definitely recommend this one, for sure. &#128077;
  I bought this for a large cat who has big claws that grow quickly and won\'t let me clip them. His other scratching post was hidden among moving boxes and his claws grew really big to the point that he\'d snag things unintentionally and couldn\'t release his claw unless I helped him unsnag them.<br/><br/>Most scratching posts with a single post are too short for my cat to stretch out. The tallest ones I could find before this are ~32 inches. He would stand on his hind legs and placed his front paws on the top part, but his head was even with the top and his front paws were near his head. I thought this one would work better.<br/><br/>I frequently bought used scratching posts, usually carpeted or sisal and he recognized the scent and took to them right away. So far, he hasn\'t really recognized it as a scratching post. I rubbed some old catnip on the base and post and he rolled around on the base. He didn\'t like me placing his paws on it. The base is HEAVY and I don\'t worry about him tipping it over. One time he did try it and got his paws stuck in the fabric middle part. I\'m planning on turning it on it\'s side so that my cat with smaller nails who is a dedicated horizontal scratcher can get his scent on it. Then turn it back upright.
  I have a big kitty and a small kitty, and I wanted a post they both could safely enjoy. The small kitty is the size of an older kitten, but he\'s a few years old, and he\'s very rambunctious, so I needed something that won\'t tip over and crush him. The big kitty is nearly as tall as the post when he scratches. The little one is so small that he can climb to the top lie down on it. They both seem to love the post so much and have stopped scratching the furniture. The post is big, but it\'s not as insanely huge as other reviewers make it out to be. In my mind, it\'s just right.
  Over the years I&#8217;ve spent money on a number of different larger scratch posts for my cats&#8230;.and they sat for months untouched until I donated them. I tried carpet, sisal mat, bare wood, etc. The last sisal post I bought was tall enough, but the flat disc that attached the top and bottom posts prevented the cats from being able to stretch up and take advantage of the height (the whole reason I&#8217;d bought them). This post is different because that flat disc in the middle of the top and bottom portions is pretty much flush with the cylinders. And the post itself is about 6&#8221; wide in diameter! I just adopted a feral cat who is learning how to live indoors. She actually jumps on this post and scales her way to the top. She loves it, and its never come close to falling over. Don&#8217;t hesitate to buy this one. I waited until I had it for a few weeks to see if it would be one more that collected dust in the corner, but I&#8217;m happy to report it is NOT!
  My 15-pound Turkish Van cat LOVES his new post, and I do too!  I like that it uses sisal rope, which he likes to stick his claws in many times every day.  Note that the post is very tall so he can really stretch out.  Two things I don\'t like so much:  1.  The colors.  I would have preferred a more stylish natural brownish color for the sisal and a lighter off white or light grey color for the bottom pad.  2.  The fact that it doesn\'t have a landing pad at the top (as his previous one did).  He still jumps up and sits atop it like a lion in a circus act, but it is more difficult for him to relax there.
  Pros: easy to assemble, very soft material and extra cushy padding. My cat (13 lbs calico) especially loves sleeping in the bottom cube part. The fabric has a nice floral print which makes it look a little fancier. The hole cut out on the third level is a lot of fun for my cat for stick her head through and hang out of. Theres also plenty of room to climb/stretch out and scratch.<br/><br/>Cons: it is pretty wobbly. It took my cat at least a day to get used to it, and I really had to encourage her with treats and straight up putting her on it until she realized it was safe. But it hasn\'t fallen over, and seems sturdy enough to handle a little wobble without breaking, so it\'s not a major con. Plus my cat really loves it now.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this cat tower.
  This scratching post is huge compared to all other posts on the market, although it doesn&#8217;t take up as much floor space as you would think in comparison to those pitiful scratching posts you buy that your cat grows out of by the time they are four months old.  My 11 pound athletic cat will run from across the room and stick to it. She is able to climb it like a tree and she can even perch herself on the very top of it and scratch it upside down.  I can honestly say this cat post is my cats favorite toy.  She has never once scratched any furniture or walls with this post around.  I really do believe that it was the absolute best purchase I have made for her and believe me, I have made a LOT of purchases.
  The last time I bought a scratching post, it was so tiny I threw it out. This one is much larger than I expected -- big enough for a bobcat or a lynx -- and sturdy. The base alone weights 10 lbs. and is 19" square. It will not tilt over when your cat uses the post. The post itself is 39" tall, 40+" if you include the base, which is an inch and a half thick. The post itself is 5-1/2" in diameter. My photo compares it to the one it\'s replacing (not the tiny one I tossed). It\'s a bit of overkill, but I\'m content with that. It seems very high quality, with velvet covering the base and ornamenting the posts. Wow!
  I have scoured the Internet for the most reasonably priced cat post and I ended up here to the exact same one that my wife and I bought years ago. This is our second time purchasing this exact one the last one lasted longer than I expected considering how destructive our cats are. It&#8217;s so easy to put together that I didn&#8217;t even look at the instructions and it&#8217;s very stable everything is tight nothing wobbles and nothing is loose and unlike posts that I have gotten in the past the top of this one is perfectly wide for my cats to perch on top and watch everyone go by. We have bought this before and bought it again and when this one goes bad I&#8217;ll be looking for this exact same one to get it again.
  Finally an affordable cat post that\'s tall enough for my 12-15 pound cats. It\'s about 3 weeks in and they\'re still figuring out that they can fully stretch out when they sharpen their claws. Just wish that the top had a little more surface area for them to sit on because they\'re always teetering back and forth and don\'t spend nearly as much time sitting on the top as they did on their old post. Also the sisal rope wraps around horizontally which means it\'ll inevitably come undone in the next year or so with how the cats pull on it. Their old post had sisal running up and down the post so there was no chance of it coming unglued from the post.
  This thing is SO PRETTY! The picture doesn\'t do it justice. The flower pattern is very attractive. I mainly bought it because the price was right and it fits my space. I had a foster kitten with panleukopenia (distemper), so my other scratcher was contaminated (safe for my vaccinated cats, but not for unvaccinated fosters), so I had to get rid of it. One of my cats really loves the little cubby (the other one had similar cubby that I wanted to get rid of, but she was so attached to it so I ended up having to relocate it after buying this one). It\'s surprisingly sturdy considering it\'s not held up by any posts, but rather a flat base. All my cats like it and I love how pretty it is :)
