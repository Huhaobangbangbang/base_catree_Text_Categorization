  So it came as shown in picture. Honestly it was not that difficult to figure out what goes where. With a picture of the product from my phone and the instructions included it took me maybe 45 minutes. It is pretty sturdy but some of the fur does come off during install. I just used a lint roller and rolled the whole thing. I took a little catnip I had and rubbed it all over. My cats seem to enjoy it and I have 3 total. 2 adult cats and a new kitten and it holds all of them. The white strap is to attach it to a wall which a screw and anchor is included.
  I just put this together, and in less than 30 mins. We used to have a taller one but my husband didn\'t want as much of an eye sore this time, so I went with this one that was medium sized. It will work well and was the best priced for it\'s features and ease of assembly. The only real difference between this and the taller ones is maybe one of the attachments on top standing a little taller. My fatty cat (pictured) checked it out immediately and played with the hanging ball, went to scratching the post, and crawled inside the little box with his fat self. He stepped onto the hammock but didn\'t stay in it. He may be questioning it holding his weight or just not interested at the moment. Truth be told, my adult cats will use it,  but it\'s perfect for kittens because of the short height between each level, making it easy for them to climb hide and play.
  The quality of this product is pretty okay. We have a kitten who likes it but it definitely would not be super stable for a larger or heavy cat. I can see it flipping over with more weight in the little hammock or from the force of a bigger cat jumping off the top.<br/>Building it is sort of difficult. The instructions are pictures, which is fine, but getting the pieces lined up/screwed together takes some patience. Probably took about an hour and the little cubby/house piece could not be mounted as described because the holes were improperly drilled. I just mounted it with the doors to the front and outside, instead of front and facing into the rest of the tree. Took about an hour to put together.
  I would like to give this a higher rating but there are a few issues with this.  The unit itself is not bad; it is not quite as big as I thought it would be; I can\'t see anyone buying this if they have a larger cat.  Mine is perhaps 8 lbs at the most; she has shown no interest in this at all, after having if for a few days.  i even sprayed it with a catnip infused spray but that has not enticed her to this.  Now as far as the instructions - forget it!  They are basically useless.  Pull up the pictures on Amazon so that you can see how to put it together.  I am still hoping my kitty will someday take an interest in this; then I will consider the item a better rating.
  I&#8217;ll start off w/ the positive, cause i honestly still love the cat tree. It&#8217;s really cute, I love the color which is a smoky grey or something like that. Now the negatives, I&#8217;m missing the hanging bed on the side. Also as I was unboxing it, the pieces weren&#8217;t the same, exactly as the product shown. Which as you can see it&#8217;s slightly different. I&#8217;m not mad that it&#8217;s a little different, but I do wish it would have came w/ that bed, so that was disappointing. Also the instructions were terrible. It took me over an hour to figure this out, or maybe it was just me. But there was little to no info on the instructions. Other than that, it&#8217;s a cute cat tree. But I do wish I had the product shown, w/ the hanging cat bed, w/ better instructions.
  First off the directions if you want to call them that were awful. It was super hard to tell what was going on. Second it was missing 2 screws to put it together. Ended up returning and paying a little more for a good quality one at petsmart.
  The little barn kitten turned house kitten needed her own space. She went WILD for this tree. Its the perfect size for one cat. Easy to assemble...took about 15 minutes. And it gives her multiple scratching posts and places to lay, or pounce on the dog. Definitly needed this! Price was right, and same day delivery! &#128077;
  My cat is 12 lbs and this item is just the size for her to sit on to look out the window. I&#8217;d recommend leaving the hammock part off though, but that might just be my cats preference. She has NO intention of sitting in that part. It is quite sturdy and I like the removable/washable ring on the top.
  Cute but better for smaller cats. My cat in photo is full grown but only 5.11 pounds (runt!) My bigger cat will sit on tip for a few to look out window but not much otherwise. The scratch posts are 2 small for an aduot cat to scratch. But.. Great for kittens/small cats.
  I received my package today. We love it. My cat Aero just has to get use to it. He doesn\'t think it\'s his yet lol
  Love it, I think I like it more than the cat. I got it in the light grey and blends in with the colors in the living room. Is really easy to assemble and the cat likes the different places where she lays. if you don\'t use the screw to attach to the wall so it doesn\'t fall, be careful though. It\'s sturdy but if she jumps from all the way in the top,it\'s gonna move away from the wall and look like it\'s gonna fall.
  This is definitely affordable and overall easy to put together. Except for the 4 interior poles to the hiding space. Those are impossible to get to line up. Once those are in you are all set. Good for our new kitten. Shorter than I expected, but good for now.
  Had it for over a month now. My month old kitty has outgrown the top part, she&#8217;s hanging off now.<br/>Top part is also wobbly now; not as tightly screwed in anymore. Easy assembly and she loves to play on. Not idea for an adult cat, they&#8217;ll outgrow it
  I really was excited when this arrived. But they sent me the  wrong model and i don\'t care for it. I wanted the one as i ordered and with the hammock. Now its already put together so I\'m keeping this one.. the material is ok. But there is no cushion at all to the " house" part or any of the parts cat would lay on. Its quite hard. I\'m going to cut out sections of plush carpeting to put down.
  A part-Siamese kitten has been on it for two months and it&#8217;s still standing.  Much cheaper than what we found in local stores and seems to measure up.
  Within minutes of assembly one of my cats jumped right in and obviously loves it. My other cat, not so much but I think that&#8217;s just a matter of time. He was playing with it when I was putting it together so I think he&#8217;ll warm up to it.<br/>Assembly wasn&#8217;t hard and I had it together pretty quickly. I don&#8217;t think this tree would work for larger cats though, but for smaller cats it&#8217;s perfect.
  Directions aren\'t great, but I did it and I\'m an almost 80 year old woman. Seems quite sturdy. I like the size.
  Doesn\'t come with all the appropriate hardware. Now I have to go to ACE and spend more money!<br/><br/>EDIT: I do not recommend this product for a rambunctious 5 month old kitten. It is not very stable, even up against the wall. Our kitty has this rocking like crazy when he gets his zoomies. Hasn\'t knocked it over yet but pretty sure he will eventually.<br/><br/>Final edit: screws are coming lose, my kitten has knocked it over more times than I can count! NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE EFFORT!!@
  This took a while to assemble and the directions were less than adequate. But it looks good and , if my cat ever decides to use it, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll enjoy it.
  Cheaply made. Cheap lightweight cardboard wood so it doesn&#8217;t stay up. Have to put weights on the bottom of mine so when my cat jumps up on it, it doesn&#8217;t fall over on him. Which as happened multiple times. The top purch is very wobbly and it will never be sturdy how much I tighten the bolts. Not worth what they have it priced at. Only reason I give it two stars is bc it does look like the pic.
