  First off, listen to the instructions. I looked at them, then tossed them aside dismissively, only to realize that the backwards-seeming instructions were actually correct. Ah well...  The cat avoided it for a few days, prolly because of the new thing in the house smell, but she loves it. I have it near a window so she can watch the birds and squirrels from it.<br/><br/>She completely ignores the top level, so I placed a large 10" potted plant on that level. I have noticed when she vigorously plays with it, it wobbles a bit, but not in any danger of falling over. It does collect cat hair and when she scratches the posts, small bits of the rope collect over time, so I keep a garment lint thingamabobber to collect cat hair and rope bits every few days.  All in all, well worth the money spent.
  This should be for kittens only not for an adult cat extremely thin and not sturdy. My cats hate it. The material is very soft but super thin, So I&#8217;m not really understanding how the product make her thought that would be appealing when I cat goes to scratch on this item. I&#8217;m going to see if I can salvage it by adding a Sturdier base and wrapping the poles with something else. To whoever created this item thanks for a pain in the ass ! good job idiot!
  This is a good product for the money. It wobbles a little when my cat jumps up on it and the scratching posts don\'t seem to be in a good position for him to actually use them. But my cat lays on the top and looks out the window or naps and he is very contented so that\'s good enough for me.
  We were looking for two cat trees for our two cats (8.5 years old and 9 months), and we thought this would be perfect for the 9 month old kitten. We were right! He loves climbing it and playing with the attached ball on the string, which surprisingly is still attached after weeks of use.<br/><br/>The only "complaints" I have would be that it does seem to wobble a bit if he jumps on it too quickly when he has the zoomies (we do have it positioned between a wall and the end of a couch, so I\'m not sure if it would have tumbled by now without that extra support), and the hole in the second-to-top level is in a bit of an odd spot. He likes to lay down and always ends up with a limb or two hanging through it. I wish it were more off to the side to give a bit more room for kitty lounging.<br/><br/>If you\'re looking for something at a good price point that gets the job done, this is it! Attached a couple photos--don\'t have a good photo of the whole thing because of how it is positioned.
  Was smaller than expected. I have 3 adult cats. They don&#8217;t like it because it rocks. The bed is too small for adult cats. I was looking for a cheap replacement for their older n bigger tree that they tore apart (which is what it&#8217;s for). Also not a great color selection.
  My cat doesn&#8217;t like it, but it&#8217;s well made for the price, easy to assemble. Good value for the money.
  This was easy to assemble and my Cat seems to love it
  Easy assembly; good scratching post
  We&#8217;ve had this for about a week now and our kitty cat loves it! It was easy to assemble, it took maybe 15 minutes or so to assemble. My cat loves to climb it and because of the scratching posts we&#8217;ve she hasn&#8217;t scratched the couch nearly as much. It&#8217;s a great cat tree for our medium sized cat. The only issue we&#8217;ve come across is that it shakes a little but on hard floors it doesn&#8217;t. Great purchase, worth the money!
  You get what you pay for. It\'s cheap, so if that\'s what you want then this is the cat tree for you. I\'d suggest spending an extra $20 and getting a nicer one.
  I would say this product is just as I expected from the pictures. my cat is playing in it a lot!
  I received the wrong piece for the middle section. The holes are drilled in the wrong place.  Plus the carpet is so cheap cat is clawing wood.  $65 is now cheap but I received a $20 tree.  One more item, tree is a kittens only.  I have a small cat and it\'s to small.
  It&#8217;s cute. Perfect size. I took off a star because it&#8217;s a little wobbly.
  This has been perfect for my aging cat as she is not able to climb or jump as well as she used to. It is soft and inviting and she usually hangs out on the top and curls up in a little ball.
  Great fabric and easy to build!  Our cat, Biggie Smalls is Twenty pounds loves the different levels. Top level is mall for him to lay in.
  Not as tall between steps than it shows.  Wish it has areas for toys.
  My cat likes this cat tree, tall &amp; big enough for her. A little wobbly since it doesn\'t anchor to the wall but I\'ve had it for a few weeks now &amp; it hasn\'t tumbled over.
  Nice looking however I would not recommend it for cats. It seems sturdy however the top perch is too small for my 7# cat to fit comfortably.
  Too small for my cats. Well made product though. Packing was good.
  Kitties love it
  Great purchase! My very finicky cat loves the plush bed at the top, sleeps in it EVERY evening.
  My cats love it.  Happy with the purchase!
  The cats love it!
  My cat loved it.  Great buy.
  Very disappointed...could not assemble because holes were drilled wrong on the bottom piece!
  My cat took a little time to decide to play on it. She loves sleeping on it and playing. Great toy for Lucy
  It\'s great, but could be a little sturdier
  It is not stable it rocks
  This is a cute cat tree for kittens or small cats. It was too small for my cats so I gave it to a friend who has a small cat. His cat loves it.
  This was a gift and they loved it.
  It\'s was perfect to set up next to a window for my cats to bird watch and get some sun as well.
  I love that it has long scratching posts, my cat uses those all the time and its not just soft padding so its not getting torn up. Its a great color and size doesnt overwhelm the room and high enough to give kitty a better view. Slightly unstable wheen he gets the zoomies and jumps straight to the top so i have little weight on the back and there is no issue!!! Recommend
