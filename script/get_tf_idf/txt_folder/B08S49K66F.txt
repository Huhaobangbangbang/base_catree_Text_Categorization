  This cat tree offered the size and perch options I was looking for! Plus I dislike the fully carpeted models and this is way more attractive to look at. I only took one star off for the sharp corners on the cubby portion and it didn\'t include a stabilizing strap. I noticed the corners before I ordered so I also got corner protectors and problem solved!<br/>It\'s sturdy and roomy enough for my 16 lb. Maine Coon and I like that it has one section of scratch post tall enough for him to fully stretch and scratch. The top perch is the largest and he lays on it with legs dangling but that is what he prefers anyway.<br/>My petite lady loves the cubby but even the big guy gets in there. This is where I keep their toys too.<br/>Happy Camper Cats!!!
  It\'s attractive, it\'s got decent construction quality. I do have some concerns about the quality of the scratchers though. About 2 months in and Maude has thoroughly destroyed one of the posts, and is working her way through another. So I could wish that the sissal was more durable.
  Great buy. The cat definitely approves.  Been months and he still actually plays with the ball things.  Hardly wiggles at all when he jumps up there and he&#8217;s 15 lbs.  The cat box thing is actually big enough for him to go in, and he does.  The other ones on standard cat trees were pointless because he couldn&#8217;t fit. This is awesome because you can wash the pillow parts, they don&#8217;t come off too easily so the cat doesn&#8217;t slide around, and therefore doesn&#8217;t hold any stench like standard cat trees.  Glad I tried this!
  Absolutely love this cat tree. I hate the carpeted ones as they end up looking so dingy and didn\'t fit in with my mid-century decor. I wanted something to blend in with my furniture and not stick out like a sore thumb but was also tall enough so the cat could escape the dogs. He loves this tree, and I was even surprised he crawled into the little box (he\'s a fairly large cat). Easy to put together, sturdy base and I get compliments all the time on it.
  The surface is too slippery as is for a cat to like it. I ended up putting carpet on all the wood surfaces and it\'s a little better. I doubt your cat will go in the box unless you put treats in there. The little toy on bungee cords is pretty worthless too. I would definitely buy something else or make your own. It does look nice though so if you don\'t have a cat and just want to waste some space go for it.
  Our cat loves this perch because of the height for looking out of the window and watching birds! We love this perch because of the removable/washable pads and the stylish look of it in the room (hard to find with a cat tree!) Highly recommend!
  So far we really like this tree. My cats love lying on the pillows and it seems very stable. I changed it around a bit to fit our needs and I love that it has no carpet.
  It was pretty easy to assemble and is very sturdy.<br/><br/>My cat still would rather sleep in the basket next to the tree than in the tree itself. However once she learned how to jump from the top platform to my bed one night at 1:46 am, she now knows how to get my attention for an early morning snack
  I did a lot of research trying to find a cat condo that is sturdy and easy to clean and was glad I came across this 1. Very stable, the pads can be removed to be washed in the machine, and it keeps my cat Mochi entertained when I&#8217;m at work.
  The instructions were very vague, just pictures no guidance.  The padding is minimal, there are 4 pcs of faux fur pads that have 2 Velcro strips to hold them on.  The only good thing about this is that you can remove them and wash them.<br/><br/>The size is good for our 3 cats.
  This cat tower is very cheaply made. I purchased this brand over the Vesper to save a little money. Bad idea! The one I was sent even had the holes drilled in the wrong spots so it could not even be put together properly. Had to send it back and will be ordering the more expensive brand
  I would have rated this product high, except the company didn&#8217;t send any wooden platforms!<br/>The delivery was surprising quick, the scratch post and washable mats were packaged nicely in the box but no wooden platforms. My cat seemed intrigued with the available contents but probably wondered why it was never assembled.<br/><br/>Probably not going to purchase from this company again.
  I wanted a cat tree that went with the aesthetic of my apartment and this was it! It was very easy to put together. My cat warmed up to it immediately. About a month later he still sleeps on it every night!
  Assembly was slightly difficult because the instructions were off and didn&#8217;t match the given parts exactly. After a month of my cats using it, it became incredibly wobbly. Not worth the money.
  Nothing like you\'re cat getting zoomies, running up on this, and then almost falls off hanging on for dear life like Simba from The Lion King.<br/><br/>Other than that, super cute and my cat who is full grown can fit comfortably.
  finally a cat condo that is not an eyesore!
  Instructions not complete, you need to measure the scratch posts to determine accurate assembly.
  Great product. No doubt

  Really cute, I just with the front pole was in the back, but it\'s cute anyway. My cat loves it.
  Looks nice very modern but wobbles a lot
  Love!

  My cat is more than 10 lbs and can stretch up to 3 ft so this is perfect. Compared to cat towers that are made of compressed saw dust, this is solid plywood so it is heavy and clearly sturdy. Not to mention that it has detachable soft touch furry cushions and not glued on surface that turns into a fur trap horror. Neat and tidy all round and is a strongly recommended purchase for big cat owners. It is unfortunate it is not 6 ft, but I cannot imagine this quality and heavy woodwork would be possible to get even larger/higher.
  Received wrong parts.  The short posts were taller than that stated on the parts sheet 39cm instead of 20.5, the longer posts were 45cm instead of 38.  Base was incorrect.  It had 4 holes drilled, instead of the described three.  Received 2 of part C and no part D.  Also missing both round rugs (part L).  We were able to make it work with a couple pieces of scrap 2x4s we already had but will have to go purchase a couple of carpet tiles to cover the wood. This was an epic fail!<br/><br/>That all being said, the materials were of good quality, but again, not all of the correct parts.
  Very easy for me to assemble, biggest thing is to lay everything out first then start. Fender\'s 14 pounds or there about and this has held up wonderfully. He can\'t shake it and it doesn\'t creak under his weight.
