 I purchased this for our family of four cats. Two are two years apart (eleven and thirteen) and came from no-kill shelters. We have had the boys since they were kittens. The other two are street-finds effectuated by my son in Nashville. The female is six years old. He kept the male. We have had her for a little over six months. Moving to Florida disrupted life for them and the others of his ood were keeping her from the food plate. She\'s mine NOW! The other is a find that his girl friend found outside her house in the street. He is two, but we took him right away. I have seen many Turkish vans in my life; this one comes without papers,  but is still the real thing.</>In any event, the tree went up easily in our retirement home in Florida. What surprised me was that the young lady of the bunch, made the hammock hers immediately. The huge fuzzy ground cat, went to live in the box at the bottom. Jack, the Turkish van, scampers up the side of the tree and makes the top post his look-out. It is MUCH more sturdy than the reviews I read here. Of course, the rope was going to go. None of our cats have had their claws removed just in case they ACCIDENTALLY get outside. I will NOT take their weapons away. This neighborhood is built in a part of Pasco County, Florida where there are feral cats on the move through our neighborhood all night long. The boys and the girl are here to stay ... inside. The tree is a very good buy for the money. I am about to order another one for our family room.\n
 This an amazing product! My cat used to sleep all of the time in her old cat tree, and now plays constantly with the hanging mouse. I rotated the top platform to make it easier for my cat to climb up and down.\n
 Great find. Four stars because one of the platform particle board was cracked when delivered. Still functional. Looks great. Cats like it with the scratching posts and hanging ropes.\n
 Made of 68 pounds of sturdy particle board, this cat house is designed to whole weight...</></>While difficult at first to put together, the finished product is well worth the cost.\n
 My boys love this cat tree! It&# ;s big and beautiful, honestly a dream cat tree lol. So far it&# ;s held up with my Chonks too\n
 My 12 year old son put this together in  trice. And while in the few hours it has been up, I have yet to see our actual cat, Chester, using the tree.  It is however,  covered in Chester hair, which I view as good sign. My son has also noted Chester scratching the dickens out of the rope tubes.  This was the entire reason for buying this (expensive) tower of pressed wood and faic.  I love my lazy-boy and DO NOT want I to be a casualty of kitty claws.</>While I do not consider myself a "pet-parent", I do believe that animals should have their own space and autonomy----a common curtsy amongst sentient beings.</>DETAILS</>1-yes, the carpet is plush and VERY cat friendly</>2-the rope around intermittent poles are a cat fav!</>3-it took my 12 year-old 15 min or less to put together</>4-yes, the leaves come with it, but why, deco for humans?</>5-catnip or cat grass scent would be nice, or at least a packet</>6-sturdy for several cats</>7-perfect for corner in ANY room. we set it up in the oversized dining room\n
 My cats love this thing, it\'s holding up nicely tooo (they do battle often an very hard)</></>Only thing i don\'t like it\'s the plastic leaves. My cats started to eat them.\n
 The carpeting is soft and there\'s plenty of things for the cats to do on this tree. It\'s very esthetic and very large. Great deal. It\'s my second purchase of this same tree and the quality is just the same.\n
 We have 2 cats (both about 9 lbs) and they refused to go on it for the first week. The one I think was afraid of the bed at the top at first but once they got used to it they love it now. Our puppy also loves the little box at the bottom\n
 Smaller than expected...my 16 lb. cat wants to love it but has trouble making his way around on it since it\'s a bit small for him. And he doesn\'t fit in the little hammock well at all. It\'s also not as tough as the "carpet covered" units you get at the local "Pet*****" or Pet**". It does look nice, but sadly it\'s not getting much use.\n
 I have two young cats (siblings), who are two years old.  I also have one older cat (a former stray) who is visibly old.  They all love the jungle.  The princess sits in the room on top, while the prince likes to play with the hanging mouse, and jump all over the whole thing for no reason.  In the meanwhile, Uncle B just sits on the base and supervises them.  It\'s so fun!\n
 fun and interesting designs make it very interesting for the cat! that and the earthy colors make it an addition to the room instead of an eyesore! fairly well made. Wide base and even distribution of the design makes for a pretty stable cat tower. Can\'t beat the price either for the aesthetic and unique builds.\n
 Better than expected! Like others have been saying, its highly annoying that the company didnt label the parts. But the final product is well worth it. We have four cats, one weighing 19lbs, and they all fit. Its super sturdy and has lots of room to play.\n
 Good quality but the shipment was bad, missing pieces and no second page of instructions. Nice for mulit cats and tall. But I am not happy. Also the two hammocks are missing screws to hold the other side together so it don\'t swing. If I could I would want my money back. On better note that Amazon was so helpful. If it wasn\'t for them I wouldn\'t have it tomorrow\n
 Don\'t buy this!! Pay attention to the bad reviews unlike I did. On the box it says 1 of 2, but I only got one box, so I was missing like 1/3 of the parts..can\'t really put it together with a bunch of missing parts! One of the beds was coming apart when I took it out of the box! It was put together with nails, same exact issue someone else had. Same thing on mine! The bottom kitty cat thing had oken corners and edges as well. We returned it, don\'t go through the hassle of buying it and realizes it sucks and returning it. Just don\'t do it!\n
 I volunteer at animal rescue taking care of our cats. I recently bought 2nd one of these for our cattery. It&# ;s all time fav of our residents. From the bottom part that some use as a hidey hole when wanting to nap to fully lounging hoping for a belly rub up at the top. Highly recommend.\n

 My cat was obsessed with this tree. I was nervous because he is 20 pounds that it would not work for him. It held him perfectly. Unfortunately due to his bad hips we had to rehome the tree to another kitty that is just obsessed with it as mine was. The bowl and the hanging mouse are a favorite for them.\n
 My cats LOVE their new house.  Assembly was very easy, it took me around 40 minutes from start to finish.  However, I thought the fake plant leaves looked a little cheesy so I didn\'t bother adding them. I highly recommend this cat house!\n
 It took a few weeks for my cats to accept this tree as their own, but after rubbing in plenty of catnip... well, my biggest one (20# large fluffy mutt cat) loves the basket. The toy has oken off, but I\'m not worried about that. It has held up quite well and is very nice looking. Some of the leaves have been chewed off by the cats, but most are still there. I vacuum it off every other time I vacuum so it stays looking nice. It is still very sturdy, and it has been pushed around a lot to vacuum carpet underneath the stand. (I bought a year ago)\n
 This cat tree is great for us.  For kitty, it is tall enough to get high above all the dog and human action, it is covered in a nice, soft short fur-type faic, and it has a lot of different spaces.  For pet parents, it was fairly easy to assemble and took less than an hour, it is compact enough to fit into a corner of the house, and the price is pretty good compared to some others.  When assembled, it looks just like the photo, but we didn\'t receive as many vines with ours.  Not a big deal, we can buy some at a local store if we want more or the ones we received end up getting a little torn.\n
 Fantastic size for the apartment I live in.  Goes together fairly simply and even lends itself to some modification in layout.  I didn\'t want to have it the full height so I used the wrench screw instead of the double ended screw and it fits together snugly.  Now to wait for them to find the tree more fascinating than the plastic bag it came in. Typical cat...\n
 I was super excited about this cat tree when I ordered it. I received it in the mail and immediately went to put it together, unfortunately, the base of the cat tree was out of alignment so there was no way for me to put the tree together. While I was frustrated I had my friend try to put it together with no luck. I will be returning this product and using the other cat tree I ordered for the time being.\n
 Were going to have to order more of the little hammocks as they love them and the company that makes this item can and will do that too!. Easy to put together, all parts were included along with an Allan wrench. I\'d post a pic to show that my trio love their new tree! Great buy and gotta love prime shipping for this!\n
 This is a very well manufactured item. It is very solid and sturdy. Took about 20 minutes to put together. My cat loves it and instantly made it his new home. I didn\'t bother with the vines because I know where they would end up. I definitely recommend this for anyone who\'s looking for a good product at a good price and free 2 day shipping with prime.\n
 My 2 cats seem to like this pretty well. They don&# ;t go on it a lot yet but hoping  they will. It does wobble a bit which I don&# ;t love but otherwise a nice cat tree\n
 Assembly is super easy and the construction is very sturdy!  I would absolutely recommend Go Pet Club...we\'ve bought 3 of them; one for myself, one for my daughter and one for my mom.\n
 This review is late but perhaps more helpful because of that. Initially it was great looking and easy to put together. After a year, we have replaced rope on one pillar. That was no problem, easy to do. The box and half tunnel have loosened up over time. I hope I can tighten it all up again. Overall very pleased. Great for the price.\n
 What a wonderful and decorative cat tree.  Its large enough to feed my cat on so the dogs don\'t get to her food as well.  She loves looking out the window on it and it makes a lovely decorative piece for the living room.  I may add different leaves and colorful flowers to it as well!\n
 I got this for my large active Bengal cat. His other one kept tipping over. This one is sturdy and doesn&# ;t tip at all. The platforms are large enough for him to be comfortable, and it&# ;s very tall which he really likes.\n
 The condo looks nice (even comes with the green vines) but once the cats get up on to the top levels, its difficult for them to get down.  The drop from the top center to the lower center is almost a straight down drop.  They try it and then fall forward and off.  The kittens got up there once but wont go again.  Maybe when they get bigger and can handle the big jump/fall down.\n
 Received one and it was damaged.  Received the replacement and it was damaged as well. How the item is being packed and the lower quality of the materials being used seem to be the cause of the damage.  I have owned this and without issue in the past, so this was a very disappointing.\n
 My kitten (8mo/8 lbs) LOVES this tree. It was easy to assemble and is sturdy enough to handle all his manic jumps and climbs. The design itself is a matter of personal preference but for me I like the look and enjoy that it does not look like an eyesore. My only complaint is that I could not use the ivy decoration as several friends including a veterinarian warned me it would be unsafe if he tore it apart and chewed it (which is exactly what he tried to do). I definitely feel I got my moneys worth and would highly recommend this to any cat owner.\n
 Easy to assemble, good instructions, durable material and sturdy. Yes the ivy is included :) My kitten has had a blast trying to tear everything apart. The Velcro along the bottom edge was the first to be pulled apart. (doesn\'t hurt anything, quickly reattaches)\n
 This ended up being a lovely purchase. Albeit once my 10lb kitty is on the top purch it seems a bit wobbly. Love that their food dish isn\'t on the floor anymore. Great incentive to entice my kitties to explore and climb.\n
 Bought this for my 16 year old cat so she might use it rather than sit on our new treadmill.  Shes very small, only about 4 pounds, and elderly. She only used the bottom half but does seem to really like it. It is well made and attractive, as far as cat trees go anyway.\n
 Got it quicker than expected.  Looks beautiful &amp; our kitten loves it. She\'s in her own little world at this point &amp; refuses to leave her tree. The only problem I had with this was that the pieces were not labeled, making it a bit harder to build. Took a bit longer than expected but other than that it was worth it.\n
 My energetic cat looooves this condo. He&# ;s a little too big for the room but the rest of it works perfectly for him! It also looks nicer than most in my living room. Worth the cost. One piece came oken but we made it work.\n
 I really wanted to like this cat tree but I will give you 3 reasons why i am returning it.</>1. It was missing 1 part which obviously was very disappointing.</>2. Its simply not big enough for a normal size cat. The only thing she fits in is the cubby hole and my cat is very petite.</>3. Everything is very narrow and unstable. I didn\'t get to build it to its full height because of the missing piece but 3/4 of the way up it was very top</>heavy.</>There is an circular hole half way up the top that my cat fell through which seemed dangerous because when she fell she went into full on crazy cat mode and grabbed the thing with her claws and almost tipped it over. The base is 21" x 32" and this thing is i think 74" high. very top heavy.\n
 Unfortunately this did not work for my large cat.  It was no where sturdy enough and the beds were too small.  I gave it to my daughter who&# ;s cats enjoy it.\n
 Our two cats (kittens when we got this) love this tree, although they have chewed most of the leaves off, they love to run, jump, and climb up the tree. They also nap on it all the time.\n
 Amazing car tree, sturdy and well made, Comes with the vines. It is all accessible by adult cats, unlike other trees in which some cubbies are only for kittens.\n
 Looove this. Had many cat trees in my life and this is so pretty and big and study! My kitty loves her food on it.\n
 My cat didn&# ;t really know what to think of the tree at first. Had to take off the plastic  decorative leaves. Smells when you first get it but that&# ;s expected with new items. Catnip and treats allowed him to get used to it. My cat loves it now.\n
 I absolutely love this purchase ! Money well spent ! My cat love this so much ! And he is a heavy boy but this handles him well.\n
 I bought this for my sister for her birthday for her cats!!!  It&# ;s not very stable and all it needs to be more  LBS on the bottom! the directions were absolutely terrible it took over 2 1/2 hours to put it together.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I know there&# ;s other cat trees out there that are easier to assemble.......  nothing at all was labeled on any of the pieces the directions or terrible!\n
 Ordered on  Wednesday &amp; came Friday evening with Prime 2 day shipping. Easy to put together, but time consuming only because it\'s huge. So far my cats seem to like it. We just got new furniture so I\'m hoping they will scratch at this instead. Very sturdy &amp; worth the money. :)\n
 This is an outstanding kitty tree, my cats have been climbing all over this since I put it together and they just love it. It\'s big enough and sturdy enough to hold all 4 of my cats running, climbing and jumping on and off of it, so I highly recommend. My only complaint would be that the install instructions were a bit hard to understand  as none of the parts were labeled. It would be a lot easier if the parts could have the letters A-F on them like the instructions specify. The only thing labeled were the bolts.\n
 Our cats find it so much fun to play on and it\'s pretty stable for the three of them to jump around on.  It looks nice too and not some generic rope tree.\n
 Extremely easy to put together. Soft. I was very pleased with this cat tree it\'s my second one purchased and the last one I bought was much smaller than the photo. This one is exactly as pictures and definitely worth the money.\n
 Cats like it, directions could have been a little clearer. And scratching post should be lower. A little unstable  when 2 or more cats play on it, but all and all I would buy it again\n
 This product is particle board and showed up oken.\n
 It was easy to put together and came with the tools to do that. My kittens love climbing on it and there is lots of things on it to keep them climbing and building strong muscles. They love the little hammock\n
 Cats totally love it. I have it set near a wall because my cats tend to be hyper and jump around a lot.  My bigger male cat can\'t fit in the basket but the smaller female curls into it nicely. Super soft material and sturdy. Totally worth it.\n
 My cats (2) and my friends love this tree. I have to admit that the kitties have torn up all of the greenery, but they had a good time doing it! This is solid and has lasted a LOT of use for a year now. Very happy with the product.\n
 this is amazing. Our cat simply loves this. It has plenty of space to crawl around on. The hole that is in the center we actually placed his food dish (our puppy was eating all his food) and it works perfectly. I would encourage anyone who has a cat to purchase this. Its well made and sturdy.\n
 I bought this a few days ago and it finally came in! Assembling is so easy and I am not a tool belt kind of person. Its very big so make sure you have room! It seems very stable but my cat (weighing at a whooping 15-18 pounds) makes it shake when he jumps on/off it. It hasnt fallen over however so I guess it is something he will have to live with! My cat used the little cave when it wasn\'t attached but now that\'s it is apart of the condo he won\'t go in; but that might just be preference. The scratching posts are great but the only downside I have about this is the weird angles. In the picture it looks like it will stand against a wall, this isn\'t the case but fear not! you can always take a few pieces here and move it there. Great material and the colors don\'t clash with many surrounding items.\n
 Eh there are better cat trees for less of similar quality. this one is sort of wobbly and the carpet/fur covered posts probably wont last long I can always rewrap in twine but meh</>It was fairly easy to put together and the cats don\'t hate it but if i had it to do over I would have gone with a different option.\n
 On the plus side it is huge and offers plenty of area to play on.  The bowl cutout is a nice option.</></>However, the only platform that is worth sleeping on is the very top one so it doesn\'t offer much in the terms of napping variety. Also the leaves are pretty cheap looking and fall apart quickly.</></>The packaging was also a mess and there was some damage to the product on delivery.\n
 Love it! It looks wonderful and the cats love it! My Maine Coon even enjoys jumping around on it at first it didn\'t seem that stable but I was pleasantly surprised to see it hold its own when he went flying off of it!\n
 The cats love it. It\'s also visually very nice.\n
 Love it! The leaves only lasted a year.. cause well.. cats.. but this thing is great! My cat just loves it and sleeps on it all day. It&# ;s definitely her spot!\n
 &#160;It\'s perfect my cat loves it!\n
 I\'ve had this product over a year and it\'s still holding strong. The only issue is the top most piece get\'s kind of wobbly but, it hasn\'t caused any issues.\n
 The cats absolutely love this.  They play like mad cats on it and I regularly place their toys in different parts of the tree and they are always playing on it and using the scratch posts.  I like the dark color also so it blends more into the room like furniture.\n
 This is a wonderful cat condo! It took about an hour to put together (I was goofing off with my cats during assembly) The faux fur is soft and everything looks to be made well. Instructions were simple and on point. No extra parts or weird directions that don\'t make sense. It\'s really nicely put together and looks like a nice piece of cat furniture. Love this !\n
 Kitty approved! They love this tree so much and are very active on it. It is holding up well with lots of play, however, the mouse was torn off by them in the first hour :/ The cats love the leaves, nooks and are stealth in surprise attacking each other :0)\n
 The tree itself look pretty good and stable but once you assemble and put everything together, it&# ;s not as sturdy as I thought it would be. One the arch arrived oken, which I was quite upset about because this tree/tower is expensive. I just wish it would meet my expectation for a price like this. My cat doesn&# ;t use it as much because it would always shake whenever he climbs on it.\n
 This cat tree is amazing! It is gorgeous, sturdy and easy to put together. as soon as we put the box on the floor our cat knew it was his. He loves the hammock which is one reason I chose this tree.Very impressive!\n
 We have a really large cat 20#. She had destroyed other cat trees, simply by being heavy.</>This tree has held up, and she likes it.</>Assembly is simple.\n
 Easy to put together.  Need 2 people -- as one must hold it.</>Not easy for cats to get to top shelf -- design could be improved.</>No cushioning.  Just thin "fur" on top of board.\n
 I was skeptical about this purchase, but I\'m very glad I decided to get it. My kitty loves it. She wouldn\'t even wait until I got it put together to start playing on it. It is very stable, and even more attractive than in the picture. It looks lovely. Also, the shipping was incredibly fast. I would\'ve had it yesterday (One day after purchasing), but my road was bad and it couldn\'t be delivered.  Definitely worth the money, plus more! I will recommend this to all of my friends! (:\n
 I read all the reviews before purchasing this somewhat pricey cat tree for my princess this Christmas, but it was worth it! Her present arrived early, we assembled it together with only a few slight modifications for her 13lb frame and it sits in our living room. Missy loves to race to the top, enjoys the hammocks and side perches, uses the ladder, and hides in both cubbies. While there is a slight sway to the structure when she is horsing around, I have no fear for her safety. She loves it and thinks it is one of the best Christmas presents she has ever received! Highly recommended for the purrfect pet in your life.\n
 This is such a good deal. It was easy to put together. Our car loves it. The elastic that hold the hanging mouse came off the first time the cat played with it, so I had to sew it back together. I attached another small mouse the other platform too. Overall, very good product.\n
 I have had this cat tree assembled for a little over two months and the basket area where my cat can lay has started to rip, this is a simple product defect but since it happened after 30 days there is NOTHING that Amazon can and will do about it.  I should not have to pay over $100 for a cat tree to last just 60 days.\n
 I love this perch!! I have 6 cats, 3 of them were on this before we could get if put together!! My son is 11 and he put most of it together so it was super easy to put together. The cats on it did make it kinda hard to assemble&#128513; other than that it\'s awesome one of the best cat perches I have ever had and with 6 cats I have definitely had my share of many perchces! I would highly recommend this to anyone with cats!!!\n
 Awesome cat tree!!!! Super happy with this product! Cats are loving it and it looks great in my apt! Exceeded my expectations!\n
 amazing!  If you can splurge on this you should.  My cat was an outdoor cat but due to living situations had to adapt to becoming an indoor cat.  She was miserable, and we tried a cheaper cat tree to amuse her.  The other cat tree was unstable and much shorter than this one. We returned the crap one, and we splurged for this one.  Best decision ever, love this cat tree. Highly recommend.\n
 The tree is excellent. I read in a description on this item in Amazon or elsewhere that the panels may expose to formaldehyde. I will cover the inside of the boxes. My kitty loves the tree.\n
 We recently adopted a shelter kitty.  She was not feeling well the first few days we had her and only sat inside the bottom hideaway.  After a week, though, she was feeling much better and she LOVES this tree.  She bounces all over it and  she scratches the posts which is saving our furniture.  The design is light and airy and does not overwhelm our room.  I highly recommend this product.\n
 My "little" boy is rough on scratching posts so I needed a new cat tower. The one I currently have is flimsy and too small for my ginger boy I was hoping this product was sturdy and tall; I want him to still be able to run and jump on it like he currently does. Assembling this tree, I was so happy that it is very sturdy and good quality, He and the girl love the tree and so do I.\n
 My cats love this! Was pretty easy to assemble and move once put together. My only beef with this is that it does wobble a bit if you have cats fighting on it, but I don\'t think it would come apart or fall or anything. This tree helped our girl get over her fear of heights and helped our cats finally get along better.\n
 Our cats went bonkers for the box this came in. Two days later they finally went bonkers over the tree. They\'re almost always in the tree, which sits in our front window. It\'s huge and it looks really great! Add some extra support though since the tiny screws aren\'t really that great\n
 Both our cats love this tower. Was easy to assemble, looks great, and doesn\'t wobble at all.\n
 Easy to put together, sturdy and my cats absolutely love it!\n
 I love it, my cat loves it, but the leaves ended up coming off of it.  When my cat chewed one off, I took them all off....lol</>sad since i got it for the leaves.\n
 The cat tree was easy to put together. However it is a bit wobbly but not too bad. I left off the vines because my cat would just eat them. I also left off the very top platform and small house as my cat is too big(22lb) to use those.\n
 My 4 cats love it. Its sturdy for running up and down. They love eating on the tree and it intises them to climb for excerise. The leaves fall off so i removed them. The shelf coverings would be better if it were heavier. My youngest cat is 5 years. Kittens would love it. None of mine will go in the houses or use the very top shelf bed. I compared for months. Lot of tree for the money and worth it\n
 but the cat will strip all the leaves. He was very excited as we were assembling it. Its a bit bulky but very tall, keeps him safe from the dog. We like that it has enough room up top for dishes, so the dog cant reach the cats food.\n
 Directions were very clear &amp; concise. Took a while to put together since there&# ;s so many pieces but it&# ;s very modern and our cat loves it.\n
 This is the second cat tree I&# ;ve bought from them, I will NEVER but from another company!! I&# ;m never disappointed and my bunny snd cat love it!!!\n
 This cat tree is sturdy. I have four cats two of which are full grown and pretty heavy. They love playing on it and use every part if it. I love it and so do they!\n
 Seems to be decent quality after assembled, a little annoying none of the parts were labeled, but after figuring out which was which and locking everything in as tight as they could go it seems sturdy and all the cats love it already.\n
 My cats LOVE it. They love the water dish, the top and bottom "den" and the scratching post aspect. They end up pulling the leaves off/down sometimes, but using industrial staples to attach them may help sucure them on.\n
 We have 8 rescue kitties and this tree/condo is simply AMAZING! It arrived four days early and in perfect condition. Super easy to assemble. Our kitties LOVE it! A+++\n
 We have four cats and everyone of them love this tree.\n
 Great cat tree. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. I have a 12lb cat that loves to sit at the very top. I have another 7lb cat that chases her around it.\n
 Very easy to assemble.  The instructions were very clear and all pieces were included.  It\'s in place and the cats are a little intimidated but are getting curious.  It is exactly what I was expecting.\n
 My cats simply adore this cat tree! they are forever playing/lounging on it.\n
 This is the first cat tree that i\'ve ever bought, needless to say I was very nervous about it. This tree is awesome. It looks great and is very sturdy. My little demoness  has tried her best to demolish parts of it with no luck. Highly recommend this tree.\n
 Huge and worth the money, a lot better than store ones! But only thing is its extremely hard more than than normal but at the same time you build it yourself, so it\'s not as comfy for the cats as it is from the store and that make than put into the store. Over all happy :)\n
 Very attractive, easy to put together. Surprisingly sturdy, though the hide box wobbles a little and rotates no matter how much I tighten the screws. Probably better for younger and/or more inquisitive cats. Mine were more happy sitting in the cardboard box in which it arrived.\n
 Meow meow meow meow meow meow. meow meow, meow meow. meow meow !\n
 My cat absolutely loves this, and it looks awesome in my living room, it\'s very sturdy also..\n
 I would do buiness with again\n
 This thing is great! It&# ;s very soft and sturdy and was easy to assemble. The kitty loves it and so do my boys. It even held both of their weight. Would definitely recommend\n
 We love it! It\'s easy to assemble looks awesome in the house and it\'s made with quality materials. We knew our cats would love it, but was unsure if our cat Odin woulf be able to fit in the basket being that he weighs 18 lbs. As you can see in the picture he does fit and it took him about a week or so to finally realize that he could squeeze him self into it but it works. I will definitely be buying more of these because the cats are in love with it!\n
 This package arrived several days ago, but I was intimidated about the assembly so I let it sit for a few days.  I decided to tackle it tonight since my husband is not home and will not try to "help" (interfere).  I took all of the pieces out of the box and arranged them in the bathroom floor.  It is crucial to close the door so that you do not receive feline assistance.  Do not be swayed by the constant crying of the cats.  They know that there is a party in the bathroom and they are missing out.  At first, I was irritated because I felt like some of the holes had not been drilled all of the way through the base of the box and I thought some of the pieces were different than the drawings on the instructions.  Here is a crucial piece of advice.  WATCH THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!  Some kind soul has posted a video on how to assemble this product.  The video saved my sanity.  Do not hesitate to watch part of it, pause it while you do a little assembly, rewind and watch that part again, and go back to assemble some more.  The hardest part is the "box".  Once you have that completed, you are golden.  After I finished and ought it out to the living room, the cats LOVED it.  I sprayed the cushions with liquid catnip to encourage them to explore.  Fat Cat did not fit in the box but I knew when I ordered that he would not.  He is a handsome hunk of cat, but at 22 pounds he is pretty large (he is on obesity management food and lost 2 1/2 pounds last year so I hope the trend will continue for the next few years).  There were a few skirmishes over territory (we have 3 cats) but I feel like each cat will have claimed his/her spot by the end of the week.  I have attached a picture of Annabelle (Siamese mix) and Biscotti (Baby Kitty) exploring the kitty condo.\n
 I love the look and design of the product. It was very easy to construct and my cats very much like the scratching posts. The deal eaker for me was that the poles and pads were all replaceable!</></>So,  i was disappointed to not be able to find replacement poles. The company has indicated to me that they have none in stock for a few months and to check back then.</></>So, until then,  we have an eyesore rather than an attractive cat condo.</></>I would think that other customers might feel suckered if they buy such a pricy piece of cat furniture and not be able to purchase replacements in a timely and definite time window.</>Buyers beware of this if your cats are all about scratching posts!\n
 This moldy garbage made our entire family sick including our cats who now have ear infections and respiratory issues because of the mold growth. See photos.\n
 I read mixed reviews and was hesitant to buy cause people said their cat wouldn\'t go near it! MY CAT WONT STAY OFF OF IT!! Did I mention how absolutely stunning this piece is? I just renovated my entire main level(and it looks amazing) but the first thing everyone comments on is the cat tree haha! Do buy! If your cat isn\'t interested put her on it pet her a little then let her explore:)\n
 I bought this product in September 2016. I liked this product a lot when it arrived. It is:</>- Sleek. Looks gorgeous in a modern/minimalistic house, matches IKEA perfectly.</>- Easy to assemble - it took me probably about 20 min to put it together and push it in the corner I wanted</></>However, 4 Months later, this is how it looked like (see pictures).</>I have only one cat, a 6 yo siamese and she\'s not out-of-her-mind-crazy about this tree. She\'s got other toys, beds and places where she sits/declaws but this was a great spot to feed her so that the dog would not reach her food.</>One rope is completely smashed while the other is about to come out.</>The pillow on top looks scratched and the threads are coming out of it.</>The edges of the wood got cracked a bit and look old.</></>I am utterly disappointed, more as there\'s no way I can fix this and it looks horrid.</>Too bad for the design, only if production would have been better.\n
 I liked this cat scratch climbing thing. It\'s been in use for about a month. We have five cats. All have used it a few times. It is very stylish everyone who has seen it has liked it. It looks great in the living room. The pads attract cat hair but so does everything lol. They have memory foam in them so I haven\'t tried washing them yet. Theyvget pretty clean with a lint roller. One of the bottom posts that have gotten lots of scratches has unravled a bit but my boyfriend just wound it back and stuck in another staple. One of the little ball things fell off (I\'m sure with lots of cat help) I haven\'t found it yet so I\'m not sure if it can be reattached but I assume so. My cats really like the high perch. I\'m 5\'8 and it goes mid chest, easy to pet a cat. The round pad thing comes off but the Velcro is attached to the base which was a bummer because it looks ugly if the circle pad thing is taken off. I would have liked it empty instead so I could have put a food dish or something. Over all I liked the product and if given a choice I would buy it again. We are thinking of getting another from the company. I took off one star because the rope unraveled, the ball came off, and the circle pad thing is annoying.\n
 Best cat tree around. I\'m not a fan of the "carpet trees" due to the accumulation of fur as well as the quickness my cats go through that particular material. I came across a Vesper unit in a store the first time and knew that it would work for our situation.</></>Upon arrival, I noticed how heavy the pieces were in the flat pack. There is only the need of a small tool that\'s provided during setup, but if you make sure everything goes in tight, the unit ends up super sturdy. All of the carpet pads are attached via Velcro, so it\'s easy to remove for cleaning or replacement. I was skeptical of its ability to keep everything in place with these rambunctious cats, but the velcro\'d scratch pad on top has taken a ton of abuse already and has never been torn off.</></>It did take a couple of days of snacks and catnip to get the cats interested, but once I moved it in front of the window, they were hooked. Top perch is still the favorite, though they still haven\'t used the poles for scratching or the cube for hiding, so we\'ll see how much use those particular features get in the long run.</></>Overall, A++++ would buy again\n
 My cats and I have had many cat trees over the years. We are now living with my fianc&#233; who is extremely allergic to cats and so I wanted to get something without carpeting that still had some scratching options and comfort for them. This tree is one of the good ones! The platforms are large enough for adult cats to enjoy and it\'s nice and sturdy also. One of my cats just adores the memory foam cushions and often you find him sitting on the top perch making biscuits on one now!\n
 Very nice product! You do have to follow the picture directions very carefully however. Found a couple of little snags while putting it together but really had it complete in less than an hour by myself, and I&# ;m a 68 year old woman.\n
 Great design, awful assembly. It arrived during COVID quarantine, perfect timing, right? We were looking forward to our first "cool" cat furniture. But...couldn\'t assemble the box house (which was STEP 1!) because the holes had been drilled too big - the screws just floated right through the holes. Not much we could do to fix it ourselves with the shops closed and no mental energy to fix anything with tools we don\'t own. So we tried skipping a few steps thinking, "maybe we could set it up for a scratch post?" But...the long screws for attaching the levels together were NOT THE RIGHT PART at all. They weren\'t even half the length they needed to be and didn\'t look like the graphic in the least. All the pieces of this beautiful kitty house lay in a messy pile of sadness on the floor for a day then were packed up and shipped back to the maker. Profoundly disappointed. The level of disappointment is probably exacerbated by the COVID mentality, but it was a real bummer. Our cat is just going to scratch the house carpet and laundry hampers until we feel up for trying for another. Later. *sigh*\n
 I LOVE THIS kitty tree!  It is a VERY sturdy durable piece! I bought the walnut V-High Base. The other completely carpeted kitty trees I have bought in the past may have more seating options and other cute little cubbies and such, but these never hold up for long and become loose and wiggle over time and you can\'t tighten them.  You have to just throw them out. The other ones are also a real pain to clean with that carpeting all over them not to mention how messy the carpeting looks after being scratched over time. This one is not as tall as those other carpeted ones I have bought, but my kitties don\'t seem to care. It is sturdy, of great quality and has not had to be tightened even once since I bought it about a year ago now.  I love it and it looks more like a piece of furniture. The little mats are attached to the sitting areas by velcro and could be removed if needed for cleaning. I have just simply vacuumed the mats and have not had the need to launder them. (I would think soaking them instead of putting them in the washer would be a better option mostly because of the velcro.) If kitty gets rid of a hair ball, I simply wiped it and cleaned it with a wet rag. The cubby area may seem to be a bit small for my older larger cats, but they still fit in it and love it this way.  I added a little blanket to make it more comfortable for them on the sides that are opened so they are not resting on the hard edges. They also love the sitting areas with the soft thick mats.  I even bought one for my daughter\'s kitties! You WON\'T be disappointed! You will never buy another carpeted kitty tree after owning this one!\n
 To start I purchased this 7 months ago, but it has been on backorder until this week.  Since I purchased the price has doubled.  This definitely is not worth 160$ they are charging now.  The quality is not horrible, but now matter how nice you make something look, fiber board is finer board and it is extremely cheap to purchase.</></>That being said, a star was lost because they did not sink all the screw holes,  they only counter sunk the visible ones, leaving the possibility for your pet to get their hair caught under the non visible ones.</></>The instructions were lacking, none of the wood parts had labels on them and the picture was generic showing the same amount of holes for each, so a proper validation of parts was not possible and it made the initial step difficult to determine the proper way to place the boards (side up side down).  They also used plastic insets instead of metal for the anchor holes.  These will eventually wear out from animals jumping and collapse.</></>I would not suggest purchasing this until the at minimal replace the plastic hardware with metal, counter sink all the wholes, and drop the price back down below 90$\n
 I have the same Product I bought in a store that was already assembled. The top and bottom of the box did not have the holes drilled through properly so when assembling, the screws damaged the sides. Very frustrating and the directions for assembly were not the best. Returning for a new one and hope the holes are drilled the way they should be.\n
 What I view as evidence of careless manufacturing my boyfriend sees as a challenge, so for around 45 minutes after I found myself listless and unwilling to humor the thing anymore he continued to troubleshoot and exhaust his efforts to make up for its shortcomings. He tried everything he could think of to make it work, but when the screws and screwed-out holes are all uneven sizes, there is only so much one can do. I know this is the sleekest look you can find for a cat tree within a certain price range, but to preserve your sanity, you should really consider saving your pennies and getting one made from real wood by a real craftsman on Etsy or something. This was a frustrating mess and a waste of time and money and we gained nothing at all for our efforts.</></>Also, I want to clarify that the cat tree is not manufactured in Germany like somebody in the question and answer section of this page said. It is manufactured in China (big surprise.)\n
 This is a terrible product- what were they thinking? I am so lucky I was home when my cat got the string toy that dangles from the top shelf tangled around his tail. He was left handing mid air. In his frenzy the toy then wrapped around other parts of his body. It was horrible, and I was so lucky I was able to get to him before something terrible happened. The poor thing was just dangling mid air in terrible pain. THIS product shouldn\'t  be sold to pet owners until they fix this extremely dangerous toy.\n
 Love! I was extatic to spot such a modern and more importantly, practical cat tree on Amazon&#128571; It&# ;s a bit of a splurge compared to others but it&# ;s worth it. Who says you can&# ;t be a cat lady and still have a nicely decorated home? Not this and! You can be classy and own cats&#128573; woohoo!</></>As for practicality, I LOVE that you can remove the padding to wash since all other cat furniture doesn&# ;t allow for this; which typically means you either need to get a great hand vacuum or throw away your cat tree every year or so. Not this! This is built to last and stay clean! My cats loved it as soon as it came out the box. Wouldn&# ;t let me work on it in peace &#128568;</></>The instructions were similar to that of ikea - only pictures and common sense. It would have been great if a few things were explained like what started upside down and then flipped over (because of this, the white inserts for the boxed in area are out of place on mine but I&# ;m too lazy to fix it).</></>The entire item is quite heavy - I could tell before putting it together that it would hold both of my cats no problem. Very sturdy. Thankfully I have hard flooring to slide the tree into location otherwise I recommend putting this structure together near the area you want it to stay; it&# ;s pretty heavy. Oh and I loved the rubber pads at the base to help hold the entire structure in place. Great touch &#128076;&#127997;</></>A small downfall is the tool to help put the entire structure together; it gets the job done but my hands started hurting because the screw driver wasn&# ;t catching towards the last couple turns to finish it off. My husband had all the tools I needed though so I used his which had a better handle.</></>Finally, the ONLY reason why I&# ;m not giving this tree a full 5 stars (and I really wanted to) is because one of the scratching posts, on one side, didn&# ;t have the threading needed to piece it all together to create a finished product!!! Oh my god it was the most frustrating thing ever! Most ppl build furniture from like ikea or wherever, complaining and having some kind of melt down thinking that the instructions are wrong but really they&# ;re not - no me. Not this time. I actually &#8220;lucked out&#8221; and got a defective part that had ZERO threading to finish it off and piece it all together. I was in dismay. I couldn&# ;t believe that the only thing stopping me between my pretty cat tree and my cats happiness was a screwless cat post on ONE SIDE &#128574; (I have pictures of one wt threading and one without for comparison),</></>Thankfully my husband happened to have a threader with size variations and threaded the part that needed it and voila, he fixed it!!! Oh it was amazing!!! So kudos to my judgment for marrying this man, his handiness and tools that saved the day&#128131;&#127997;. If it wasn&# ;t for him, I&# ;d be going through multiple email exchanges and waiting days to fix the problem wt a partial cat tree in the middle of my living room.</></>Best of luck to you! Hopefully my story helps you be proactive for any and all potential challenges &#128573;\n
 Quality build, easy as heck to put together, and so easy to clean. My ONLY complaint is that the "cave" box orientation requires the cat to jump up into the box, rather than facing the lower platform so an old creaky/massive cat like my big orange tabby can easily climb up into the box. I wound up drilling two new holes and turning the box to face the platform, so problem solved (it was super easy), but I would love to see this come with the option to have it turned either way. Younger cats have no issue jumping up in there, but for any over-sized or old cat, that\'s not feasible.</></>It\'s worth noting, however, that the box does not really fit a large cat well at all. My orange tabby isn\'t fat, but he\'s a pretty darn big cat (14lbs). He\'s obsessed with caves, but he gave up on this after a couple attempts to wedge himself inside. Here I was thinking he\'d fit, but as always, once I finally get whatever cave-like product I bought put down for him, I realize just how big he is.</></>I\'d say that for anyone with particularly large cats (maine coons, especially) this may not be the tree for you. My shockingly small 4lb main coone (I know, insane right?) doesn\'t even use it. I should have realized it before buying it since she\'s more of a "bush cat" than a "tree cat" (meaning she prefers to be down low rather than find high perches), she doesn\'t use the tree at all. Since my orange behemoth of a cat is old and creaky, he hasn\'t used it much either, so do consider the age of your cat. It might not be so easy for them to climb.</></>My sister\'s cats, on the other hand, are all over this thing constantly, and she put the cat food up on the top platform so her fat whale of a cat has to burn a few calories hauling her lard-butt up to the top for kibble.\n
 I wanted to like this so much but alas it does not serve my feline family well. I think the landings are too small. The middle landing does not have a pad but a small circle scratch pad, they avoid when I set them on it. I tried nip treats. Everything! no go on this. If I still had the box I would return it: I still may have to. Very pricey for what it really is. I could design a better cat tree with removable pads.\n
 My spoiled cat Helvetica needed a new cat tree. This should be a simple thing but coming from a design background I of course couldn&# ;t have the run-of-the-mill carpet covered cat tree. I literally spent over a week looking for the perfect cat tree.</></>Not only did I want something with some style I also had to find something that fit into the space I had and I wanted something with at least 2 levels. I also am not a huge fan of the carpet covered look and one thing most people don&# ;t realize is that some of these products have formaldehyde so pay attention to that. Finally, I decided on this cat tree and I&# ;m really happy with my decision (and so is my cat).</></>This is quite heavy which is a good thing. The box shown in the beginning was the first of three which is great for a cat owner. :-) After getting everything out and organized I got to work. I honestly didn&# ;t time how long it took me to put it together because I was doing a million other things but I would say it didn&# ;t take more than 1/2hr. The hardest part was putting the box together, mostly because it is the first step so I was getting my bearings. Make sure you pay attention to the velcro for the scratch pad- this will tell you which piece is the top. Also, make sure you pay attention to the square- you will want the front and back to match.</></>It is very helpful to be aware of the label on the bottom front this will help you figure out where certain pieces go and keep the picture on the box handy as this helped me a lot too.</></>All of the hardware and tools are included but I did grab a philip&# ;s head screwdriver to make it easier on me.</></>The only other thing I found difficult was trying to keep my cat away while I was trying to build this! The good news is it is very sturdy and my cat loves it. The other good news, we just got a new kitten and she is using the new kitty condo as well. I&# ;m so glad my week of research paid off!\n
 I foster kitties and so I need something I can sterilize jic someone gets sick. This is a beautiful unique cat tree. You can add carpet with velcro or even insulated beds. The scratchers are super sturdy and it provides plenty of kitty shelter even if it is extremely compact and fits in any room big or small. I will be buying from this company again and again as do far they are officially my favorite makers of cat furniture. They seem to "get" what a cat wants,  what a cat needs, what ever keeps them happy sets them free and I\'m thanking them for knowing exactly...</></>It\'s easy to put together for people who can read directions and are not me.  However, my boyfriend assembled it pretty easily. Looks like this is a perch cats will get a lot of use out of. Especially if placed next to a window. We got caves for cave dwelling cats. Perches. Beds. It\'s amazing.</></>It will really hold up against time and use too.</></>Highly recommend this to all my cat people and friends.\n
 This is my first Go Pet Club cat tree.  Honestly.... Cheap.  It looks nice but, it is scaled down.  The diameter of the scratching posts are smaller than any other cat tree I have owned. The shelves are not fully covered, (top and bottom) but I have found that with other and too. However the shelves and the bed are small and thin. The edges of the bed or perch on top are very thin almost sharp. The holes for the bolts on the bottom are not sunk in anyway making them a danger for scratching a wood or tile floor. One of the first things I noticed when putting it together is the screws on the nameplate were sharp. They caught my fingers.  I purchased a Trixie and product 4 months ago for $26.00 and the quality was awesome.  Now that I have said all of this.  I am keeping the product. I will put it in a room in the back and the cats will use it.  Since I have had many different ands of cat trees I can compare. This is an acceptable product if one did not know there is better. I will not choose this and again.\n
 The price is right; easy to assemble; and I think they like it!\n
 When I bought this I figured my cats MAYBE would use the top bed part and would definitely ignore the bottom ball "IQ" part. Turns out they LOVE the top part and one of them adores getting the balls out of the bottom toy so much I had to go buy more balls just to keep her amused. This cat tree surprised and impressed me. Definitely worth the money and then some.\n
 Took me less than 30 minutes to build it, while I was building it, the cats (I have 2) were curious and snooping around. Once it was built, one cat looked at it, played with the balls in the box and walked away, the female cat loves it, she loves high places, and sleeps on the bed at the very top, when she\'s not sleeping, she\'s playing with the mouse, swatting it.\n
 Very easy to put together by myself. None of the cats have played with the box with the balls in it... The first step could be a little longer. The top area is just right for my medium sized cats...It gets used because it\'s a great way to look out of the window or take a nap.\n
 A decent cat tree from the local chain pet center would have been $150+.  This was less than $50.  As such, it has some drawbacks.  The base is 1/4" pressboard, so there is not a lot of stability if a bigger cat wants to leap to the top shelf.  For that reason I have it aced against a wall.  The bolts that hold it together have exposed heads, so I had to mount furniture glides underneath to keep the base from scratching the floor.  The exposed bolts on top I covered up with an ancient lambskin (see pic).  The upper shelf is a little shallow, but the cat figured it out pretty quickly.</>Update 14 Aug 2020</>I just bought a roll of twine to repair what my cat has shredded on the cat tree (see photo).  He doesn\'t seem to want to scratch the center post, just the two side ones.  But those have taken a serious clawing.  I am well pleased with this cat perch.</>On the plus side, it was amazingly easy to put together.  I had it done in about 15 minutes.  The upholstery is nice and soft, but needed a few days to air out. Once the smell was dissipated the cat jumped right in.  Hasn\'t figured out the box with the plastic balls, though.  Probably a good thing, because the balls have little bells inside that could prove to be a problem at 3 AM.</>The only upgrade that I think it needs is a decent square of 3/4" pressboard glued under the base to provide good stability if the cat chooses to launch up (or down) and to cover the exposed bolts.  Other than that, I am satisfied, especially with the price.\n
 Update: Still going strong with a 3rd cat in the mix. Really a quality product. Fairly easy to clean and our cats really enjoy it. We did take the box part off because one of our cats so nicely got sick on it. But it hasn\'t affected the integrity of the cat tree at all.We have had this cat tree over 6 months it was definitely worth the money.</></>I have two young cats one is about 9 months old and the other is 4 months old and we were looking for a cat tree to put near a window that would fit full gown cats and provide carpet for scratching as well as scratching posts and this one was the best price and we felt the most bag for our buck.</></>It was easy to assemble, the bed can be turned at the top and our 9 month old kitten who is super long bodied can comfortably lay in it. The different step sections are large enough for your average adult cat to lay as well and our younger kitten has been enjoying the mouse.</></>It seams fairly sturdy and light weight as well\n
 The product arrived in a timely manner and was neatly packed with all the parts included plus an allen wrench to assemble it with.  Go Pet Club IQ Busy Box Cat Tree has a large heavy base which makes falling over not likely to happen.  The only wobble to it occurs when both of my cats are jumping around near the top of it.  Both of my cats had to check it out once I put it together.  My larger adult cat didn\'t seem too interested in it over the first couple of days.  My younger and smaller cat feel in love with it from the start.  My larger cat looked a bit uncomfortable while trying to lay in the top circular level on his first try.  However both of my cats have since fallen in love with the Go Pet Club IQ Busy Box Cat Tree.  The larger cat sleeps most of the day on the top and the smaller cat switches places with him at night.  Overall it\'s a good buy.  BTW, neither cat seems interested with the busy box despite my adding some cat nip to it.\n
 I bought this particular design (45") May 16, 2019, so my cats could get to their window table. I have multiple bird feeders on the other side of the window for the cats\' and my enjoyment. Originally their bird-watching console table had been between a couch and the window, but when the couch went the table was too high for the old cat, the fat cat and the unhealthy cat to reach from the floor. So what I needed to find was steps. Official pet steps are pretty much just for getting to a sofa seat or bed. So I started looking for something to use as steps or levels and finally found the 45" tree here, which is basically steps with the top one exactly level with their shelf/table. Perfect.</></>This does work very well as the needed steps. The basic structure has held up pretty well, despite frequent use by 3 large (I think of the black one who snuck in through the pet door a year ago last winter as small, but he is 8 1/2 skinny pounds) cats. I didn\'t think that the little bed at the top was going to get much use, but my old guy turned out to like it, even though he hangs over the edges. The toy with the balls in the box hasn\'t been used at all. But the post for the middle step turned out to be the fat old (I resemble that description myself, so no judgement) cat\'s new favorite scratching post. And in less than a year she got through the rope and the cardboard tube, to the point that the stability of the whole tree is threatened.</></>I contacted support at GoPetClub about buying a replacement post. They get points for quick response, and $10 is a reasonable price for the post, but with shipping and handling that went up to $23, or over 1/2 the cost of just buying a whole new tree. It\'s still exactly what I need, so I\'m here to order another one, ensuring replacement parts for everything but that front post.</></>So the cats will still have more and newer furniture than I do.\n
 Kitty loves it. Sturdy wood, carpet is bit thin. Busy box is sturdy and cat played with it initially. She loves sleeping on the bed up top and playing with the dangling mouse. Good price. Fast shipping. Arrived missing a screw and delayed my setting it up...but customer service was quick and efficient.\n
 This is amazing cat tower! It has very nice design, very sturdy, easy to assemble. My cats already love it! They have a lot of fun with the IQ game on the second level. It was a much needed upgrade for my home because the old cat tree is too small for my boys. The reason I chose this model is because my cats love chilling on the cat tower but they are big and they don&# ;t fit on the old cat tower anymore. This one has large shelves where the boys can sleep and hang out. I also don&# ;t like towers with houses because both of my boys like open space and don&# ;t feel comfortable in small enclosed spaces so this tower was excellent choice for their needs. The only downside is that the most part of the two long poles is covered in some cheap faic that sheds a lot and the cats will rip it apart very quickly. It would\'ve been better if the manufacturer upgrades this model and wrap the long poles in sisal from top to bottom but I guess I can do this on my own when the time comes to strip off and replace the faic. My cats are super happy! I recommend the cat tower!\n
 Overall, this cat tree is a FANTASTIC value for the money. We bought it as a cheap way to keep five rescue kittens entertained and give them more places to be during their time with us as we work to rehome them. The tree goes up easily, with simple instructions and easy-to-understand images of what goes where and how things attach with either the hex keyed, single-ended screws or the double-ended screws without heads on them.  Comes with the hex key, so you don\'t need to go get one out of a toolbox.</></>The tree is light and easy to move around the room. It does sway a bit when kittens are on it, but it appears stable and has not tipped over. Overall, we like it and so do the kittens. If we planned to keep the tree for ourselves, we\'d definitely go with a sturdier, more expensive cat tree. This one, though, will go to the home that adopts the last kittens. We recommend this cat tree, with the caveat that it may not be as durable and long-lasting as the more expensive cat trees.\n
 Our two kittens took to it like a magnet to metal. All of the different levels and toy box keeps them busy and the scratching posts are actually used quite often which is one of the main reasons we bought this, that an the incredibly reasonable price and easy setup. Assembly instructions were very clear and it took only a few minutes to setup. The large base makes it very stable. As our kittens grew to almost full size (10 months) they continue to enjoy its many distractions and levels. I was concerned that the carpet-like material covering the platforms would encourage our kittens to use it as a scratch pad. In our case, it did not!\n
 Super impressed with this. I was originally interested in this because of the good reviews and because there was a sale or deal offered through Amazon giveaways, so I didn\'t have to pay full price. I put this together with "help" from a friend\'s toddler -- that\'s how simple it was. I didn\'t pay close attention to the instructions when we were assembling it, so I had to switch out the posts I had put on with the correct ones once or twice, but it was not a hassle. My cat thoroughly enjoys it, especially the top shelf and the hanging toy, although she hasn\'t been interested in the activity box towards the bottom. I wish the overall tower was a bit more level, as it wobbles a bit, but I\'ve put it up against the wall and it\'s not a big issue. I would recommend this product.\n
 My cat has attacked this tree relentlessly, and it still stands safely.</>Personally my cat did not care about the game box, she never uses it even if there are toys in it. Knowing my cat\'s personality I would find one with a different game in the front.</>The only thing my cat loves are the scratching posts and the tunnel that she can sit in/on.</>I have owned it for about 3 years now, it does show wear mostly in the stand legs because my cat has scratched the cloth off. I could glue it back on or remove it to show the bare legs, but I really don\'t care.\n
 I have purchased other models of Pet Club cat trees before and have always been pleased with the quality. This time, much less. My cat is 14 years old and weighs 9 pounds. Jumping into the top perch rocks the unit and frightens her although happily it has not fallen over. It is stable enough as long as it it aced against a wall or the patio doors but then I have to move it out a couple of inches every time I open/close the doors. As a free-standing unit it is dangerous. I am keeping it only because for the price it is not worth the effort of taking it apart and repackaging but will also need to buy a more stable unit.\n
 I\'m really liking this product. It\'s pretty sturdy and my cats really enjoy it. It\'s tall and can be tucked in the corner and mostly out of the way depending on how big a place you have.</>I do have it against a wall since it could potentially tip over but I think that\'s the case for most cat trees.</>It took a little bit to assemble but it was easy enough.</>I\'d recommend it if you\'re looking for a good cat tree for a few cats or even just one since it\'s pretty big and good for older cats more than very young ones.\n
 Bought this for my elderly Siamese to be able to climb up to window sills and she hate it. The covering plush is a little &#8220;slick&#8221; and doesn&# ;t really allow for claws to catch and help her balance, so she avoids it. My slightly younger Siamese/oriental mix LOVES it - although it&# ;s really clearly meant for kittens or smaller animals. Both my cats are older so they don&# ;t use box toy at the bottom, so I will remove that, but they do like using the scratching areas and The elastic cord mouse. All in all, for the price not a bad unit. My only caveat is I wish it was covered in true carpet like many are - I suspect my older furry would feel safer in it if it were.\n
 This is solid and fits together well, and is pretty easy to assemble. I\'m giving it 2 stars because of poor design and small size. It\'s not a good fit for cats over maybe 6 or 7 pounds; my two are 10 and 11 lbs and didn\'t use it at all even when I hid treats all over. I\'m guessing that\'s because the platforms and little house are too small to really be comfortable for them. The angles are kind of weird - I\'m not sure how a cat is supposed to get onto the top level, since it\'s blocked by the toy box, and they can\'t really play with the balls inside the box because they\'re mostly unreachable from most of the platforms. All those holes in the top are useless because they\'re not where a cat could reach them. I think this is probably better for kittens (why would adult cats need a ramp? it\'s too steep for cats with arthritis or other issues...), but my criticisms of the toy box design still hold. Nice idea, poor design. If you have small kitties, it might work better, but I ended up getting a Kitty City cat jungle gym instead and put it in the same place. Within days my cats were all over it, and it\'s continued to be a favorite ever since.\n
 The cat house is too small for larger cats. Back when my 15.5 pound kitty was about 10 pounds, he couldn\'t fit in there. The faic that it is covered in is thin, soft to the touch, and silky. There is no padding underneath either. There have been a couple of times when he tried to run and jump up to the top quickly, slipped on the silky faic, tried to catch himself, but couldn\'t get a good hold of the faic and had fallen off. He loves laying on top, but since he is a big kitty, and it must not have been built for so much weight being thrown around on it, the top tree leans and wobbles even with screws as tight as they can go. Works okay when pushed up in a corner against a wall. Might want to screw the top section into the wall unless you want to hear it hitting against the wall as it wobbles all around when they jump on this. Would be better if sturdier and covered in a thicker, less slippery faic that would be easier to sink their claws into more.\n
 I moved to a rural area and had to change Gus the city cat into an indoor cat or he would become a snack for a coyote. Gus went mad with frustration and also went FAR more than rotund since he found less for a young cat to do in the house. He kept me awake at night while trashing the place. The climbing system (with additional plastic toys for him to toss to the floor) offered hope that he would be entertained and also maybe slim down. I worked it between some bookcases that he likes to sit on top of. At first he refused to acknowledge the addition. Kitty treats placed up along the steps helped introduce Gus to the shelving, although that did rather defeat one purpose for the climbing system. Now he keeps me awake at night thundering his 30 pounds along the wall as he attacks plastic sharks and feather toys. So yes, the system works...but beware of secondary results. Sigh. At least HE is happier.\n
 This is so great! I love it, two of my cats love it, the other is vertically challenged... she&# ;s never liked going higher than the couch. Anyway, I have bought quite a few catastrophic creations and I plan to keep buying more, I love that I can add to it, it&# ;s fairly customizable... I find myself on Pinterest looking for ideas!</></>It was awful installing, me and my boyfriend are not at all handy. I struggle hanging a picture! A few of the screws oke in half and I can&# ;t tell you how many I stripped. Also, the drill bit it came with snapped in half, there is still a piece in my wall. Lol no but I think normal people shouldn&# ;t have an issue installing this but if you&# ;re not good at this type of stuff definitely get help from someone... who knows how to use a drill haha I think our biggest problem was drilling in at an angle instead of straight so it&# ;s nothing wrong with the product or hardware it is 100% user error!  My cats love it! I plan on buying a few more plain shelves and installing them throughout the house, they&# ;re not tacky at all! My older cat, who is super timid, doesn&# ;t really trust the canvas parts (I think this is just the wood one but if you buy other ones with canvas!) she is super hesitant about going down the little canvas idge thing but she loves laying in the canvas shelf thing... geeze this review is probably super painful to read I&# ;m sorry I&# ;m awful at wording and then I probably make no sense.... my cats love it, I love it, I want more and someone else to install them lol\n
 These cat shelves exceed our expectations. My wife wanted something streamlined that wouldn\'t take up a lot of space on the floor like our cat tree had. Additionally, she wanted to be able to wash or easily switch the cushions to keep the cats\' area clean. With these cat shelves, we\'ve accomplished both of those goals. Her initial concern was that at 11" inches they wouldn\'t be deep enough to comfortably accommodate our largest cat. As you can see from the photo, though, they are perfect for him (top shelf), as well as our other other two smaller cats. Prior to purchasing them, I realized that each shelf would only be able to mount into one stud due to the framing of our home. For mounting the opposite sides, I opted for some 80 lb drywall anchors, and the shelves are extremely sturdy and secure in the wall. The installation instructions were easy to follow, and the overall quality of the shelves is excellent. Honestly, they could be nice floating shelves for applications other than cats, too. We are very happy and highly recommend them.\n
 These selves require \'stud\' which is limiting when catifying a wall...they aren\'t as sturdy as other shelves.  If used as a step, they are not bad for the money and look nice.\n
 This shelf is exactly what I hoped for--I put it on an upper ledge of a tall window. (Tried to take a picture but the lighting obscures it). My kitties jump from the top of a cat tree to a sisal shelf to get up to it, then can laze away the day watching birds and squirrels. It is extremely sturdy and can handle two cats easily. It is attractive and actually adds to the d&#233;cor. I learned about Catastrophic Creations at a local cat caf&#233; and am now contemplating what pieces to add next!  Everything was included in the kit that we needed to hang it up, and we were careful to hang it where our studs were. I have to add that this company included an extra screw, which was great because we accidentally crushed one!\n
 This shelf only took about 10-15 minutes to install, may take a little longer based on your level of construction skills.</></>Overall, great shelf and a hit with our cat right away! I needed a shelf to put under an over head window since the cat found out he could jump from his cat tree to the upper window. We did not want him to get hurt and the shelf now allows him to get up to the window safely, he can bask in the sun, and also has a new spot in the house to relax.</></>Great shelf well worth the money!!\n
 I\'m so glad I purchased this shelf. I debated because I thought I could find a floating shelf at a home supply store cheaper. However, after a couple of trips to Home Depot and Menards, the only floating shelves they had were made of plywood and cheap veneer. They also didn\'t hold as much weight as this shelf and weren\'t as wide. This shelf is real wood and beautiful and is also very easy to install. It\'s big enough for two cats to sit on at once. I love the look.\n
 The install went well and the shelves seem very sturdy. Nice finish on them as well (am using carpet tiles so the cats have something to grab onto and seems to be working well. Happy with purchase (and there had been a small glitch with my order as 2 shelves were not included in the initi\n
 I love the hidden ackets on this shelf to give a floating appearance. The kitties love it, my large orange tabby has taken a liking to the shelf and lays on it every day. I installed over a bookshelf because the kitties were climbing on my books and use it in combination with other cat shelves to give them an elevated run on the wall.\n
 Just installed one of these shelves and will be buying more. Very high quality.\n
 First off, listen to the instructions. I looked at them, then tossed them aside dismissively, only to realize that the backwards-seeming instructions were actually correct. Ah well...  The cat avoided it for a few days, prolly because of the new thing in the house smell, but she loves it. I have it near a window so she can watch the birds and squirrels from it.</></>She completely ignores the top level, so I placed a large 10" potted plant on that level. I have noticed when she vigorously plays with it, it wobbles a bit, but not in any danger of falling over. It does collect cat hair and when she scratches the posts, small bits of the rope collect over time, so I keep a garment lint thingamabobber to collect cat hair and rope bits every few days.  All in all, well worth the money spent.\n
 This should be for kittens only not for an adult cat extremely thin and not sturdy. My cats hate it. The material is very soft but super thin, So I&# ;m not really understanding how the product make her thought that would be appealing when I cat goes to scratch on this item. I&# ;m going to see if I can salvage it by adding a Sturdier base and wrapping the poles with something else. To whoever created this item thanks for a pain in the ass ! good job idiot!\n
 This is a good product for the money. It wobbles a little when my cat jumps up on it and the scratching posts don\'t seem to be in a good position for him to actually use them. But my cat lays on the top and looks out the window or naps and he is very contented so that\'s good enough for me.\n
 We were looking for two cat trees for our two cats (8.5 years old and 9 months), and we thought this would be perfect for the 9 month old kitten. We were right! He loves climbing it and playing with the attached ball on the string, which surprisingly is still attached after weeks of use.</></>The only "complaints" I have would be that it does seem to wobble a bit if he jumps on it too quickly when he has the zoomies (we do have it positioned between a wall and the end of a couch, so I\'m not sure if it would have tumbled by now without that extra support), and the hole in the second-to-top level is in a bit of an odd spot. He likes to lay down and always ends up with a limb or two hanging through it. I wish it were more off to the side to give a bit more room for kitty lounging.</></>If you\'re looking for something at a good price point that gets the job done, this is it! Attached a couple photos--don\'t have a good photo of the whole thing because of how it is positioned.\n
 Was smaller than expected. I have 3 adult cats. They don&# ;t like it because it rocks. The bed is too small for adult cats. I was looking for a cheap replacement for their older n bigger tree that they tore apart (which is what it&# ;s for). Also not a great color selection.\n
 My cat doesn&# ;t like it, but it&# ;s well made for the price, easy to assemble. Good value for the money.\n
 This was easy to assemble and my Cat seems to love it\n
 Easy assembly; good scratching post\n
 We&# ;ve had this for about a week now and our kitty cat loves it! It was easy to assemble, it took maybe 15 minutes or so to assemble. My cat loves to climb it and because of the scratching posts we&# ;ve she hasn&# ;t scratched the couch nearly as much. It&# ;s a great cat tree for our medium sized cat. The only issue we&# ;ve come across is that it shakes a little but on hard floors it doesn&# ;t. Great purchase, worth the money!\n
 You get what you pay for. It\'s cheap, so if that\'s what you want then this is the cat tree for you. I\'d suggest spending an extra $20 and getting a nicer one.\n
 I would say this product is just as I expected from the pictures. my cat is playing in it a lot!\n
 I received the wrong piece for the middle section. The holes are drilled in the wrong place.  Plus the carpet is so cheap cat is clawing wood.  $65 is now cheap but I received a $20 tree.  One more item, tree is a kittens only.  I have a small cat and it\'s to small.\n
 It&# ;s cute. Perfect size. I took off a star because it&# ;s a little wobbly.\n
 This has been perfect for my aging cat as she is not able to climb or jump as well as she used to. It is soft and inviting and she usually hangs out on the top and curls up in a little ball.\n
 Great faic and easy to build!  Our cat, Biggie Smalls is Twenty pounds loves the different levels. Top level is mall for him to lay in.\n
 Not as tall between steps than it shows.  Wish it has areas for toys.\n
 My cat likes this cat tree, tall &amp; big enough for her. A little wobbly since it doesn\'t anchor to the wall but I\'ve had it for a few weeks now &amp; it hasn\'t tumbled over.\n
 Nice looking however I would not recommend it for cats. It seems sturdy however the top perch is too small for my 7# cat to fit comfortably.\n
 Too small for my cats. Well made product though. Packing was good.\n
 Kitties love it\n
 Great purchase! My very finicky cat loves the plush bed at the top, sleeps in it EVERY evening.\n
 My cats love it.  Happy with the purchase!\n
 The cats love it!\n
 My cat loved it.  Great buy.\n
 Very disappointed...could not assemble because holes were drilled wrong on the bottom piece!\n
 My cat took a little time to decide to play on it. She loves sleeping on it and playing. Great toy for Lucy\n
 It\'s great, but could be a little sturdier\n
 It is not stable it rocks\n
 This is a cute cat tree for kittens or small cats. It was too small for my cats so I gave it to a friend who has a small cat. His cat loves it.\n
 This was a gift and they loved it.\n
 It\'s was perfect to set up next to a window for my cats to bird watch and get some sun as well.\n
 I love that it has long scratching posts, my cat uses those all the time and its not just soft padding so its not getting torn up. Its a great color and size doesnt overwhelm the room and high enough to give kitty a better view. Slightly unstable wheen he gets the zoomies and jumps straight to the top so i have little weight on the back and there is no issue!!! Recommend\n
 I don\'t know how I feel about this product... I mean Chloe Rose loves it, but now she doesn\'t want to lounge on me to get a quick nap. I\'m feeling kind of abandoned...Best-worst thing ever! (Sniff)\n
 I told myself that I would never buy a cat tower that I had to put together.  But I was reading the reviews on this one and everyone was saying how easy it was to put together, so I bit the bullet and ordered it.  I am so glad that I did!  It only took me about half an hour to put it together!  As I was finishing it up, I was thinking to myself, "Watch, these cats won\'t show any interest in it now that I\'ve put  in all this work into it!" (everyone who has cats knows what a perverse sense of humor they can have!)  Literally 5 seconds after I had finished the tower and put it into place, all three of my cats were on it and having a ball!  They love the dangling jingle ball and rope!  As I\'m writing this review right now, I hear jingling bells in the background!  If you are thinking about getting a cat tower, you will love this one!  It is six feet tall and very sturdy when put together.  I will definitely get another one of these if I need another cat tower!\n
 I really love this cat tree and so does my cat! I was a little worried about buying this cat tree online because you can\'t tell how big (or small) they are. Some of these trees seem to be made for kittens. But this tree is actually very big and has lots of space for a full grown cat! There isn\'t any of the shelves, tubes or beds that she doesn\'t fit. My cat is not huge but for a one year old cat she is bigger than most of my friends cats! She has lots of space even in the little box, which she loves! (See attached pictures of her lounging in it!)</></>Pros:</> - It is sturdy and doesn\'t seem like it would ever tip over from playing or pulling on it.</> - It is about 5 feet tall from the floor to the top of the bed on top.</> - It is really soft</> - It looks nice</> - It was really easy to put together and comes with everything you need</> - It even comes with an anchor strap for attaching it to the wall</> - Big, spacious areas for cat to play</></>Cons:</> - I\'ve only found one, which is the two upper shelves are almost the same size so it is hard for my cat to get from one shelf to the other. She almost feel the first time she tried to climb up. But she\'s found other ways to get up.</></>All in all, I think this was a great buy and recommend it to other cat lovers! So I rated it 5 stars!\n
 This was a great buy. Very easy to assemble and is very sturdy. We only have one cat but seems to be sturdy enough for several. It also comes with a strap to mount to wall for extra balance if you wish to use, we didn\'t think it was necessary but it is there if you need it. Don\'t hesitate on puchasing this cat tree.\n
 I&# ;m in love with this cat tower. I spent hours upon hours researching the best tower at the best price. We knew we needed a high tower so our kitten could escape our dogs and young kids but we also knew this tower would be in our living room and would need to look nice. After 2 weeks of use, I&# ;m very very very happy with this purchase. However soft you think it looks, double it- I could sleep on this if they made it large enough!</></>Nothing in this world is so perfect it couldn&# ;t use improvement, this tower is no different. There is a bell toy that hangs from the bed that our kitty loves. The first day we put it together (I did it by myself and it only took about an hour) our kitty got her claw stuck in the bell and began screaming. I got her free and thought it was a fluke. 3 days later the same thing happened so we decided to remove the toy all together just to be safe.</></>Even with the bad toy choice, we really are happy with this tower I will recommend it to all of my friends and buy another one if we ever get more than one kitty. I am writing this review of my own free will. I did not receive a discount or special offer for a positive review. I simply really love having something this cool in our home!\n
 This tree is pretty big. I&# ;m 5&# ;3&#8221; and the to bed is above my eye level.</>Our 16 month old cat, Kira, loves this cat tree. She got the ball off of it pretty quickly.</>Loves playing with the rope and scratching on the rope wrapped posts. Took her about a week to get to the top bed, now that is her favorite place to sleep. She just started using the cylinder and the opening above it the past few days. Wants nothing to do with the hammock. It is sturdy. She hits this at a fun and it does not wobble or top. She is not a big cat, probably 8 lbs.</>I would recommend this cat tree and I would buy it again.\n
 I was so excited when I saw the tree and felt how soft it was. Tree is for my niece and nephew furbabies and I wanted it to be fantastic for them. Started putting it together and all was going well. Until we got to the middle shelf with box and hole cutout. Carpet was glued to the wrong side of the board. Or straight up holes drilled in the wrong place to start with. This made the box attachment holes not aline up. Fixable with a drill to make a new attachment hole. But, fustrating to buy a product at a great price and then have issues with craftsmanship. Looks to be a great product otherwise. Just be ready to alter assembly instructions.\n
 Initial Review:</>My cat and I were really excited to received and put his new cat tree together today. We were almost done with assembling the pieces, when I came across the sisal post that goes at the very top connecting the top plush bed to the rest of the cat tree, and found the bolt that was supposed to be attached to one end of it just randomly laying at the bottom of the box/package. The plastic on the end that the bolt was supposed to be securely screwed into was completely torn. Needless to say, our installation came to a half and my cat&# ;s cat tree is not finished. We are so sad.</>I&# ;m kind of relieved because who knew how stable that bolt was inside the sisal post. To think that it could have oken while my cat is perched up on the top bed. I can&# ;t even imagine my cat falling off out of nowhere because of a defect in the sisal post and bolt.</>I sent an email to the company hoping that maybe they can just send a replacement part for the oken part I received. I&# ;d hate to have to disassemble it all and I know my cat would hate to see, what was supposed to be his cat tree, sent back.</></>If you purchase this, I highly advise to inspect all pieces and parts before putting it together for the safety of your cats.</></>Updated Review:</>After contacting the seller, they have been really responsive in sending me a replacement of the oken part. I received the new piece wrapped securely and was shipped all the way from China! It took over a week to receive the item, but that\'s because of the international shipping. I right away installed the top bed to the pole and my cat couldn\'t be happier! Thank you, Bewishome for being awesome sellers!\n
 Wow, first of all, it came in a very timely manner,</></>2) wasn&# ;t THAT difficult to put together, only real &#8220;difficult&#8221; part was finding the holes sometimes only because of the faic, (no biggie though because you don&# ;t want to see that infection it&# ;s all put together anyways just takes some time finding them to set it up)</></>3)it seems to be extremely sturdy! It even has a strap on the back so you have the option to stabilize it to a wall if you feel the need to. I however have not done that and it&# ;s not moved a bit! And my babies are all pretty big!</></>4) we&# ;ve never lived in a place big enough to be able to give our babies their own area, or cat tower, and sooo GLAD we can now!! They&# ;ve been kind of uncertain about it until two of my babies figured out a couple of spots, our BIG white cat weighs approximately 15 pounds, his spot is the hammock</>Our little Persian, she&# ;s always looking for a dark, hidden place, so when I showed her the condo, that was IT! She stays in there pretty much all jc the time now! She has REALLY come out if her shell!!</></>My MAIN purpose was obviously for my babies to have their own area, but, also toTRY to save my furniture and curtains lol, they are constantly sharpening their claws on my couch &#128545; I&# ;ve noticed that is slowing up a bit!! I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this!! I totally WISH I could afford another one, OR add on to it going outward to Mae a larger area for them!! Hopefully one day I can!! Thank you so VERY MUCH!!\n
 Built it with a cat insistent on &#8220;helping&#8221;.  It took about 2 hours due to fuzzy interference.</>The carpet is very thin. After having it for 2 months, my cats have already stripped the carpet from some of the pillars.  (And I clip their nails regularly).</>The top shelf is wobbly and unstable.  The twine is a very thin cord size.</></>They skimped on materials.  Given the choice, I would have chose a different cat tree and spent more money on one.\n
 I have two kittens that are just under 1 year old. They LOVE this cat tree. I\'m not a very handy person, but was able to easily put this together. Just a warning the instructions came in a different language, but every step had a picture to show what needed to be done.</></>The cloth material is VERY soft and my kittens absolutely love the feel of it and sometimes prefer sitting on it instead of with me!!!  I thought they were going to like the hanging hammock, but they really want nothing to do with it other than bite at the rope that holds it. oh well!  This is a plush cat tree and with all the ins and outs, they play on it most of the day.</></>I gave this 5 stars because it really is absolutely amazing, but there are a couple downfalls:</></>1.  The blue cloth does "shed" a bit all around the floor. It may be from my cats scratching at it or just normal wear and tear. I don\'t mind too much, but for some people, it may be really annoying.</>2. When being used by active cats, it did wobble a little bit. My cats are just under 5 pounds and 7 pounds. They would push themselves off it or wrestle on it and it would shake a bit. I ended up putting a 10 pound weight on the bottom just to make sure everything was safe and secure.</></>Otherwise, this is an amazing product and i have very, very happy kittens!\n
 I bought this cat tree for my older cat because, in my new apartment, I don\'t have any easily accessible places for my cat to be able to climb easily. Plus, it had a lot of features that I thought my cat would really enjoy. This tree assembled very easily, and I did not have any problems with the instructions. The majority of my apartment is carpeted, and I did notice that this tree did get a little wobbly since it wasn\'t sitting on a solid surface. That is not really the fault of this tree though and more of a downside of my carpeted floors. I fixed this issue by getting some corner aces from the hardware store for about $5 and using them to secure the tree to the wall. After I did that, the tree got much more stable. It took maybe a week or so before my cat finally started getting up on this tree on her own. I think it just took some time for her to adjust to it being there and to realize that it was for her. She seems to really enjoy it now, especially the little enclosed area. I don\'t really see her getting much use out of the hammock and I think the tunnel was probably designed for smaller cats and kittens, but I figured that would be the case when I purchased this tree and I was really more concerned with making it easier for my cat to get some elevation in her new living space. The only complaint that I have about this product is the bed at the very top of the tree. I thought my cat would really enjoy this because it feels super soft and comfortable and it provides extra height that would allow my cat to get on top of my bookcase if she wanted to, but since it is only supported on the top of one little pillar, it does wobble a significant amount when my cat tried to jump up to it. Since it is farther away from the wall than the back side of the tree, it makes it difficult to secure that to the wall like I secured the rest of the tree. So, until I find a solution to that problem, my cat will probably not utilize that feature. I think it would be improved if there was another column to support the bed; it probably would not look as nice, but I think stability takes a higher priority in this case. Overall, I think that this tree is a very nice looking cat tree compared to many of the others I saw, it was very easy to assemble, and it is a pretty solid cat tree with lots of nice features for cats to enjoy. Would recommend.\n
 I can happily say my kitty-cat loves this tree/tower!! It\'s very sturdy wood, easy setup, looks nice, soft top pillow/bed, twisted rope leading down to the strong tunnel, nice size bedroom, stretchy string with a ball &amp; bell, lower hammock (my kitty has never showed interest in) &amp; all the scratching posts are tuff &amp; tight. Silly kitty didn\'t know how or what they were!! It was the cutest thing when she discovered it was for her claws to knead on! For 2 weeks my husband &amp; I would scratch \'em to get her to knead. I even tried running her paws down \'em too but she wouldn\'t tract her claws. The looks we would receive was hilarious to say the least. It\'s a good price for the happiness it has ought into our lives. I recommend this 100%.\n
 I bought this in January 8, 2022 for my 2 cats. one a kitten one a small adult.  The flat part above the little boxed in area has zero support on the sides and only the two posts that are directly under the very top cat cushion bed... it is now Feuary 7th 2022.. The whole top of the tower is now leaning and crushing the boxed in area with the weight of the cats as she will lay there and bat at the little ball hangind down. This is a design flaw in my opinion as we have to figure out how to put a board or a post of some type INSIDE the "Cave" to keep the upper floor from collapsing and toppling the whole thing over. I am actually quite diappointed in the fact it has only been a month and this issue is arising .. I would say PASS on this one and go to something more sturdy ..\n
 This thing is big! However the features themselves such as the tube, cat house, hammock and top platform are a little small. Our adult cat is average size and is pretty cramped in all the features. The tube is particularly small. It\'s a little wobbly on the very top when he\'s on it. He always slept in the top of his old cat tree but haven\'t seen him do that with this one, probably because it is too small for him to comfortably lie down. But he does squeeze into the house. He doesn\'t fit in the hammock at all. This would be great for kittens.\n
 Cats freaking loved it from the moment I opened the box! I\'ve even got new holes on my for proof.. my girls helped me every step of the way! Except when I had to litterly dump one out of the square box&#129315; instructions are pictures,and I have alot of extra screws (I didn\'t put on the tunnel due to fat cats and they won\'t use it at all on the tree).. they wrestled on it not long after I finished and both fell off,and it staid up!! They found a new place to enjoy,so I\'m happy.</></>I\'m not able to upload the pictures, like AT ALL, for this product.\n
 Everything went together easily with the supplied tools.</>- Setup time was about 30 minutes.</>- Accommodates one larger cat on the second level tier and a smaller cat on the upper perch.</>- My younger cat loves the tube and hangs upside down while I play catch with him.</>- Offers a four-point steady base and is very solid without wobble.</>- Includes a nylon attachment point and hardware for customers wishing to secure the stand to a wall.</></>One CON&gt;</>- One hole was not drilled to secure the middle cat box to the middle-upper tier.  Really did not need it since the box is secured by three other bolts at the bottom.\n
 Kittens love it! Cats love it!  You won\'t be disappointed!  I did have to adjust the height of the hammock in order to keep it off the bottom level, but that was easy enough.  The large flat piece on the upper level is probably its best feature, especially if you have larger cats.\n
 Both our kittens love it and it seems this tower will be able to hold them as they grow. The only thing is the square-ish enclosure part had holes drilled for an upside down installation and some mysterious parts of the fluffy cover material came off (but we can&# ;t see from where). Other than that the light grey is the right color, the size is right and variety of features keeps them interested. The top perch platform seems to be the little one&# ;s favorite hang out spot since she&# ;s vertically challenged.\n
 Absolutely the best decision I&# ;ve made! I have 4 cats and they&# ;ve never had a proper cat tower, so when I was looking for one I found this one and saw it as the best deal for what I needed. The instructions are simple, the pieces fit together nicely and as long as you screw the pieces on nice and tight it doesn&# ;t wobble around. Make sure the top little bed part is on the tightest because I know a few reviews say that it eaks off but my 15lb cat fits on it relatively fine. The little house is a perfect napping spot and my little kitten loves laying in the tunnel and swatting at the rope through the hole. Even while I was putting it together they were laying on the parts! A little bit of catnip and they easily got used to it, and lounge and play on it all day. I&# ;d suggest putting it next to a window for the best results, because it&# ;ll keep them off other windows and counters for the most part. I&# ;ve had it for a while and it seems to be holding up pretty good, but there&# ;s always that rare chance that some of the parts might be oken, so just make sure you inspect the screws, holes and seams of the faic just to make sure it all checks out. But it&# ;s been a real life changing buy for my cats ever since I got it!\n
 My human servant made a good selection with this one. After my last tree oke (she will try to blame me but we all know she was just jealous) I had no where to sit high above my humans and judge them. This tree is much better. It is super sturdy and doesn\'t shift as I jump from the 2nd floor onto it in a death defying leap!! My human thinks the hammock is fool proof with these clips, but rest assure I will figure out a way to get it off. The plush bed at the top is the best for me to rub my head against before yeowling at the top of my lungs. And don\'t forget the bell and ball!! It was made to annoy the humans.</>I think I might puke in her shoes later tonight to show my affection.\n
 My cat was crawling up the curtains, so I started looking for a condo for him. I shopped for about an hr. When I saw one I liked I put it my shopping cart. Then I saw i liked this cat condo in my cart twice, well that\'s how I ended up buying this one. Its sturdy built n NOT one hole was off a centimeter. I emailed the company to tell them how much I liked it. The instructions do come w it. Some other people were saying they didn\'t receive the instructions. I\'m glad I bought this for my furbaby.\n
 Overall: We have two super energetic kitties and they absolutely love it! They like running around the floor day and night, but after when they got this tower they spend so much time playing and resting on it. We&# ;re even sad that they won&# ;t spend much time with us on the couch anymore! Lol</>Sturdiness: Looks sturdy enough with two kitties chasing each other up and down.</>Assembly: Although my arms hurt for couple days after assembling it, I think it was simple enough for one woman to put it together.</>Cons: -1 star because the pieces of faic started to fall on the floor in couple days. (Third pic)\n
 I bought this doohickey for our new baby, Oreo. I should have done it a long time ago. I had a cat that I loved very much. She was the best little cat. Petite, she never bothered anyone. She liked sleeping in our carport in a lawn chair and one day a husky and pit came into our carport and ripped her apart. There was nothing we could do &#128542;. She was such a good baby. About a month or so later Oreo showed up outtano where. We let the GrandPrincess name him. I bought the doohickey. I\'m hoping it will save his life!!\n
 This is a really nice cat tree for the price. The covered platforms are "fur" covered, rather than carpeting, and it is not as dense as one would hope, so it sits kind of flat, but R2 and D2 like it and haven\'t complained yet and this is nice and high so it gives them some climbing exercises that they don\'t get much of as indoor cats who were once ferals. Even R2 got up on it and she is very finicky. Think she is just trying to stake out some territory for herself before D2 claims it all. All in all, very happy with purchase and had no issues.\n
 I love having this for my 2 cats, mom an daughter. They each have their own favorite spots. As I know they don\'t mind it, I however had a horrible time figuring out the instructions. They don\'t label anything and you would think it would be pretty straight forward. It was difficult and yes usually I never have any issues putting something together but this was like Ikea stuff. Definitely worth the pain and time though. I do have to keep tightening 2 of the upper sections also.\n
 I took my time assembling this, and I think that\'s what saved me. The old woodworkers\' adage about measuring twice to ensure you only need to cut once saved me several times as I almost used the wrong post or hardware. I used the directions to double-checked myself several times throughout the process.. I used several plastic containers to separate the hardware and made a separate pile for each type of post. It wasn\'t difficult to assemble and only took me about 30 minutes. Everything was well packaged upon arrival, especially the hardware that was wrapped in plastic and taped all around. (Definitely have something to catch all the hardware as you unwrap it.)</></>My kitten loves running up and down it and no longer scratches the furniture because he loves attacking the posts so much. He loves the different activity spaces and all the different ledges, especially the top one so he can look down on me and my dog. I like to hide his toys in random places in the tower so that he has to hunt them so that he\'s engaged while also getting some exercise. The tower is very study, safe, and long-lasting.\n
 It has been a year since we had this delivered. For the prize we are happy it has lasted this long, it has definitely survived 2 active cats using it everyday, however, it would have been nice if instead of the soft fuzzy faic that has as a cover it had come with actual carpet material so that the cats could climb verstically instead of just jumping from level to level. That is why the 4 stars instead of 5.</></>But for the price we paid, it is a good deal\n
 2/3 cats used it pretty quickly, though that\'s more of cats personal preference than anything the company did. But 0/3 cats use the cubby hole, tube, nor hammock (though they like boxes and cat tunnels so that wasn\'t a consistent indicator) So if you\'re willing to spend the money for a little something extra, stick to the plain platforms and scratch areas unless you know they\'ll use such features. It\'s really sad to spend an extra 30-40.bucks and only see them use the very top 2 platforms. :( I\'d stick to this and, but wish I\'d gotten a simpler tree.\n
 I\'ve had this product barely past the return window.</>The top piece fell off with my cat on it! He fell off and landed on the floor, very angrily.</>This was assembled correctly, but the wood was simply not strong enough to hold my cat.</>My cat is rather small, but this wood was still too soft.</>This was an inexpensive product... But I\'m rather upset that his favorite spot fell off today...</>I\'ll be contacting the seller so they know about this design issue.</>Picture with cat on top is from when I initially installed.</>Lastly, the parts were pretty hard to tell apart, but aside from the manual, this tree installed nicely.\n
 I like the tree ok for my two adult cats. My problem is that they have a difficult time figuring out how to go up and down it. Especially, when on the top they tend to jump from so high up, I&# ;m afraid they are going to hurt themselves. They aren&# ;t young cats by any means and not very small either. The house or &#8220;square&#8221; could definitely be larger. They don&# ;t use the tunnel at all. And never use the hammock because it just touches the ground if they were to anyways. Unfortunately, we switched from a different tree and are not as satisfied this time around. But who knows it may be just right for your cat.\n
 Luckily it was still able to be assembled but 3 holes were drilled in the wrong spot, the condo had to be installed upside down to make up for it and the hole to balance the top platform over the condo didn\'t line up at all so I\'m worried about the stability of the bed on top of that platform. My cat loves it though. He\'s 16lbs and it supports him great. Since it was still able to be assembled I don\'t want to bother exchanging or sending it back but I\'m still dissapointed and frustrated. I just hope it doesn\'t cause problems.\n
 &#160;My cat wouldn&# ;t touch this tree for 3-4 days. Then my kids started giving him attention, and suddenly he&# ;s exploring on his own. The carpet is softer than expected and it&# ;s fairly sturdy (haven&# ;t yet wall mounted it). It&# ;s narrow so I&# ;m not sure how a big cat would maneuver it- especially getting down unless in a single jump. But plenty of places to scratch and hide, so I&# ;m happy with purchase.\n
 We bought our first cat tower in March. It&# ;s held up REALLY WELL! We have 3 cats. 2, 4 month old , 5 lb kittens and their momma @ 7 lbs.  We wanted a second one so after a bunch of shopping came back to this one and bought it again! But it&# ;s been up only a week and within a couple days the ball&amp; string fell off and the rope completely came out of the housing yesterday. I&# ;ve tried to placate contact seller directly  but to no avail. I&# ;m kinda disappointed in this one &#128533;\n
 I bought this for my 13-pound tabby cat and he is very happy about it! Loves climbing up there to lord over the dog from the many perches and cubbyholes.</>Assembly only took about a half hour, and the provided instructions were really easy to follow. Screw a piece in there, twist the posts into place, and, voila, your cat tree is complete.</></>My only note is that the base of the tree could be heavier for stability&# ;s sake, but I feel that can be pretty easily addressed by throwing a couple of weights onto it. They provide a little screw to anchor the tree to the wall, too, but if you&# ;d rather not punch a hole in your wall and be able to move it around your house at will, I think finding some cat-friendly weights are the best bet.\n
 The fur on this item is of such poor quality that it ripped when my cat tried to scratch one of the posts. The "cave" is only fur so now that has holes in it too. This is not worth the money I paid for it. I do like the styling of it and the size but would not recommend this to anyone.\n
 I like that there is enough room for both of my cats. One cat likes to climb high, the other prefers the cubby. Now she likes to drop her toys into the hole and scoot them out of the tube. It was very easy to assemble, comes with everything you need. The only thing i wish was different is for it to be more padded, it is like a faic on a hard surface, but it\'s not bad. The cats like it and I\'m happy with it. *Update - I think I like this faic better, seems not to collect hair as much and easy to clean.</>I have two female cats, one is skinny, one is chunky. The chunky one fits in the cubby. If it was a male cat that was really big, they might not fit, but the walls are stretchy faic. I don\'t think either cat has went in the tube, the skinny one might be able to, they just like to play with getting toys into or out of it. They haven\'t tried the hammock yet, I think I\'ll tighten it a little, they might try it.\n
 I have 24 indoor only rescue cats. We just recently lost our home in a flood and we lost everything but each other. Buying my cats two of these towers was one of the first things I did. We are limited on space, as we are in a temp home, otherwise I would have bought more. If we ever find a new home, they&# ;ll have several again!!</></>Just having something familiar helped relieve some of their stress, and mine.</></>These towers are sturdy and easy to assemble. They are easy to clean and surprisingly, the rope stays on pretty good.</></>The only problem they have is deciding who gets the hammock!\n
 I only have one pretty large cat, so I downgraded from my Go Pet Club three-perch, two-enclosure, two-ramp tree to this one as I figured that the previous one was overkill.  My previous tree always often required maintenance (retightening screws and ackets) and the perches were completely unpadded.  My cat loves it and uses more elements of this tree more than he did in my Go Pet Club model.  He only used to use one of the perches and very rarely used any of the enclosures.  Now he loves his new padded perch, loves the enclosure, and the open surface on the top level is also nice for him to sprawl out on.  The material is also much softer.  Easy assembly as well.\n
 My wife and I must&# ;ve bookmarked over a dozen cat trees and read dozens of owner reviews trying to find an acceptable tree that both the cats and we would love. We are very happy with this tree!</>Great faic, durable (so far after 3 months), the scratch posts are still in excellent condition, they enjoy and use each part of the tree. Both my cats are adult and above average size (not weight) and they fit in the top perch perfectly. I usually come downstairs in the morning to find them both sleeping or looking outside together. The own faic doesn&# ;t look ugly and matches our living room fine.\n
 Extremely poor staples on the top tier I didn\'t even notice until I saw a cut on my cat\'s face from it at least 4 of the Staples at the base of the top pillar were not made correctly so I\'m going to have to figure out a way to solve it and likely have to ing my cat to the vet because of this.\n
 I was concerned at the height of this for my young cat, but after putting it together (which was fast and easy-about 20 minutes total) I realized that it is very sturdy and solid. It is larger than I expected so thats a challenge, but overall this is a great tower for the king of the house. He loves it!</>The only thing I would recommend is not to install the rope toy. I found pieces of it that my cat had chewed off and I didn&# ;t want him swallowing it so I removed it.</>Highly recommended and I know you&# ;re cat will love it too!\n
 Our Belsnickel absolutely LOVES this! We shopped locals first, but they couldn\'t beat this design, and their cheapest price was $25 more than this one. This cat is absolutely nuts about it! If she\'s not running around and jumping around on it, like an absolute maniac, she\'s enjoying her perch at the top, for a nap, overseeing her kingdom. We\'ve spent much time, sitting together, and laughing hysterically, as she enjoys this. MONEY WELL SPENT! The material is very soft and fluffy, not like the carpet texture we were expecting. If I have any concerns, it\'s whether or not the top perch will last long, once she reaches 10+ pounds. Perhaps a wider base for the perch. And we purchased this model because it was the closest to all the features we wanted, but still, we couldn\'t find a model with an angled, scratching board, where the hammock is. She\'s not a fan of the hammock, and if we could purchase and install a separate, angled scratching board, in place of the hammock, we certainly would. Even if it was a special order. All in all, would definitely buy again, especially a model with a scratching board and not just posts.\n
 While this was fairly easy to assemble and the cats loved to play on it, the top part oke while my cat was sitting on it in the middle of the night. We have only had this for about 6/7 months too. He only weighs about 9 lbs so you wouldn\'t imagine that would be an issue. Luckily, he was not hurt when this happened. I have submitted a video of the incident as it was caught on our security cameras. The cats seriously loved this thing though, so we are sad to see it eak. The top part took the bolt with it so it is unable to be fixed. Disappointed.\n
 Overall, great purchase. I got this for my sister who has two bengals. They&# ;re lanky and about average size, maybe even small in my opinion, as far as cats go and the male seems to dislike the tube. The other reviews mentioned their cats having a hard time fitting in it and I can definitely see why lol that and the fact that the hammock is on the bottom.. they aren&# ;t really comfortable with that. And then the box house on the middle tier has a gap between that and the top level - which is also weird. The cats try to wedge themselves in there, but can&# ;t, so it has left us wondering why the manufacturer didn&# ;t just make the box house taller and meet the bottom of the top level.</></>All in all though, the cats really like it, it&# ;s a &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; kinda size (not too small, not too big), and the blue-grey color is even prettier than I&# ;d imagined.\n
 Easy to assemble, feels more solid than some I\'ve seen, the plushy material covering is a bit slippery and being up against hard particle board, the kittens slip off occasionally.  I would say maybe a thin layer of something under the material would pad it and make it better grip for cat claws, other than that, good value.\n
 My cat would not go near this  thing before she reached 8-9 months old, now she loves it. She goes like a lightning bolt across the room up the couch and up the car tree. I put it on a 2 foot tall end table now the top bed is about 18 inches from the ceiling and cats love to observe from above. Update 10/25/19 Cat still loves it but accessories are wearing out, the hanging rope is completely frayed and she ripped the hanging ball off. Would be nice if the accessories could be replaced.\n
 &#160;It&# ;s super cute and exactly like the picture but the very top piece is not super sturdy. It&# ;s very easy to assemble. My cat is 13 lbs and about 18 inches in length (not counting her tail) she&# ;s able to sleep on the top platform comfortably :) however my cat can barely fit in the small little &#8216;room&# ; and also the tunnel&#8230;my cat&# ;s a little overweight but if you have a smaller cat it&# ;ll be perfect for them.\n
 Highly recommend. Great price for the product. I had no issues putting it together and I hadn&# ;t even had the first part of the instructions done and my kitty was already wanting to play on it. She patiently waited and played till I had it done and then she didn&# ;t want to get off of it. I really like that they offer so many colors too so you can match it with your home decor.\n
 It looks good and with two kittens it has everything in one place a hammock, tunnel, multi levels with toys along the way, a house when they want and two levels on sunning as t sits by one of my front windows. Lots of scratching posts too! All for a very reasonable price. Word to the wise make sure you tighten all of the fittings Very tight...tighten, take a eak then tighten again!\n
 Just got this new cat tower- in the photo the new on I just put together is on the right. My old, well cat loved one on the left I got at Petsmart about 7 years ago and I included it in my photo for comparison. The new one was very easy to put together- I would be careful not to overtighten the screw together joints or you could risk popping out the metal connectors. Theres really no need to over tighten it anyway.</>The carpet appears to be similar to the carpet on my original tower. Some reviews I read prior to this purchase stated that their cats shredded the carpet- well guess what???? Thats what cats do and its better they shred on the tower than your precious couch&#128521;! Let me repeat that- cats love to shred on carpet! You can sprinkle a little catnip on this to help train them that this is their space to shred away! As you can see in the photo of my old one it is well shredded- you can take scissors and trim the frays from time to time if needed and the rope can be replaced as needed also. The lower perch on my old fell off last week- its fixable- just need some screws.</>Some reviews also stated their cat could not get up because if the configuration of the perches- then something is wrong with your cat! Cats are natural climbers and mine are like flying monkeys racing up and down the tower! My male is 18lbs and has never knocked the original over even when he is having major road rage- it will teeter a little but it always rights itself. Really stable and sturdy- this new tower appears to have the same building sensibility put into it.</>Just out if the box I am happy with this purchase  and would recommend it to a friend!  This new tower cost me about $40 less than my original one on sale at Petsmart for $180. So that was a plus!  I will update how it goes in the future if anything comes up.\n
 One post wouldn\'t screw in tightly and was unstable.  Top perch wouldn\'t screw in tightly-you could spin it around like a bicycle wheel.  Even though the tree is heavy, it wobbles a lot!  My cat would never get on a tree like like this!  The sisal is attached with staples.  The staples stick out and are extremely dangerous dangerous!  Your cat could catch it\'s nail and that would not end well.  Do not buy!  I wish I could give it zero stars for a rating!!!\n
 Easy to put together &amp; very good looking tree but...... like many others, I too received a tree where the tunnel &amp; seat were drilled so close together that it makes them lean into one another. I also didn\'t realize that since these levels are placed upon one pole stand and not two, this makes the tree shake when the cats are on it. My older Siberian doesn\'t fit very well on the tree and gets scared when it starts to shake, but our baby kitten loves it.\n
 The bolt does not screw into both. It only screws into one side. The ridges on the other side don&# ;t work.</>This was a used product. What they forgot to say is that one tower doesn&# ;t screw in to damaged machine screw bolt. Took $14 and several hours to identify problem and make new parts fit. But it works now and cats love it.\n
 Absolutely love it. I bought other ones and returned them because they weren&# ;t sturdy, this is sooo sturdy for my cat, I love it....</>I have a 18lb cat that loves to fun up his on and needed one to do that... he&# ;s in love.</></>&#8220;People, it is fantastic&#8221;.\n
 My cat stopped using his previous cat tower because the cardboard was weakening and he didn\'t feel safe.</></>He\'s a big cat (18 lbs)  and I know it tipped over on him once.  So, I spent a good deal of time searching for a good solid tower when I found this one.  I was sold on the "solid wood" and manufactured in the USA.</></>Once I put this together, I noticed it was shaky, not sturdy. The partially covered round perch gave way when my cat tried to use it, then he stopped again. It was loose, so I had to unscrew the other post with the highest perch first before I could fix it. I tried screwing the rounded covered perch all the way in but it was never tight enough until the opening part of the circular perch was facing the other post.  Certainly that won\'t work, my cat wouldn\'t even be able to get in &amp; out of it!</></>It was a horrible struggle, but we managed to put a thick cloth around the post that connects to the other sisal rope post.  That was the ONLY way to get it tight enough to be stable. After all that, now the whole tower wobbles from the very base. It seems the very bottom platform and connecting posts should have been configured smarter, differently, to offer more stability.</></>On one side especially, if my cat were to run and climb quickly to the top, it will tip over.  The base is way too short with less than desirable positions for the posts.  So now I have to see about anchoring it to the wall for the kind of "sturdy" you advertise.  So much for "Made in America."\n
 My cats loved this tree, and in principle, it\'s the best one out there for design and durability. But it seems there\'s a bad batch in stock at this point, and I\'ve replaced it twice now, hoping for one that hasn\'t been returned already. But no joy. The posts are attached at an angle to the base, which is itself warped and unstable; the staples used are 3/8" and meant for paper, NOT carpet, so they pop out and are dangerous to the cats; and the phone number for customer service is routed to nowhere, directing that all contact be through email, which never elicits a response.  True that some negative reviews lack common sense, but I wish Amazon could take more responsibility for quality control of the products they sell.\n
 My cats use it and seem to like it enough, but not nearly as much as their other cat tree, and it\'s not just the placement in the house. The tube with the "window" is definitely awkwardly placed. They have to either crawl out the window to get to the top, which they rarely do, or scale the opposite side of the tube, which they do frequently. They don\'t have quite enough footing on the tree for scaling the other side, so there is a lot of struggle and clawing their way to the top. My cats are young, so it\'s not really problematic (and a little comical), but I could see it being a big issue for older kitties that want to be in that high perch. Even my young cats mainly use the scratching posts and the second level perch. It is pretty sturdy, as long as you have it on level ground and it  does look nice. Super, super easy to put together and all my peices fit. The top nest is nice and deep, which my cats also like, but I feel like they don\'t use it much because it\'s difficult to get to. With two cats trees, I\'m happy with this, but would consider a cats abilities before purchasing.\n
 The updated new model in ivory was so easy to put together and easier to move than the last model, which was all in one piece. The cats had claimed it and were sitting in it before I could put it together! They insisted that I keep the old battered one as well, so now I have one in the bedroom and one in the living room and they romp between them. I recommend this company\'s cat trees very highly, and so do Apollo and Cecily!\n
 Max is a big boy so I needed to find something that would fit him comfortably and wouldn&# ;t topple over when he climbed. This is so sturdy and strong! Max took to it immediately and is so happy. This is where he perches and looks down on us little people; king of the world! Haha! He loves the carpet to scratch and being able to jump around in the different levels gets him frisky. I couldn&# ;t be happier with this purchase. I&# ;ve bought towers before that are fake wood and light duty. This is definitely not one of those. Great product, won&# ;t buy anything else now.\n
 This was SO EASY to assemble! It\'s very sturdy, and well made. I had dreaded putting it together so much, that it sat in the box for a week. After removing the parts from the box, and the cats from the parts, it took less than 5 minutes to assemble. The cats all love it, and they have staked out their new property. Very popular!  It has gone over so well, I bought another one! New Cat Condo\'s are GREAT!\n
 Well,  I am giving this cat tree a second updated review.  Actually, if it had not been for the problem with the parts screwing together securely I would probably have given it 5 stars. But it took my son a lot of work to get it to be secure.  Still, it is a great cat tree, nice and tall and heavy. Well made, other than the screwing problem. Anyway, my BabyKitten utterly loves it.\n
 I love the style and height of this cat tree. My cat loves it too....his favorite is the enclosed oval. Unfortunately, the material is cheap. All the carpeting is coming out and there are plastic strings all over the place. For the price, I\'d expect higher quality.\n
 Very big, solid, sturdy. I did a lot of research before buying and glad I did, it&# ;s not the best looking cat tree on Amazon but it&# ;s definitely great quality (from what I read the more stylish ones fall apart quickly or don&# ;t fit the function of a cat tree, this one has a perfectly placed scratching post and great heights to climb). My cats are not a year old yet but this will fit through to old age.\n
 I got this for my 14-15lb cat. It&# ;s been 2 days now and he hasn&# ;t been wary of it at all and surprisingly, did not freak out because something new was added. He immediately sat on top of the stuff to explore when I opened the box. He seemed more interested than put off by the smell and started rubbing on everything. It took me 5 minutes to assemble, but an hour to disassemble the top perch from the pole. I decided to take off the top bed but keep the pole because there wasn&# ;t much space between the bed and the top of the tube for my cat to stand up or have the ability to jump up there. I kept the pole in case he wanted to scratch on it. I&# ;m very happy with the size of the tube and the beds. The tube is big enough that he only has to crouch a little to stand, and he is easily able to turn around in it without having to stick his face out the window. I think the window of the tube is big enough that he could climb through it if he tried. The other perches can very easily hold him without him spilling out the sides like on his old tree. There is even extra room for him to spread out on the middle one. The only thing I&# ;m disappointed by is how close together the middle perch and the tube are. The tube slightly hangs over where the middle one is which means there isn&# ;t as much room for him to jump. It&# ;s fine for getting inside the tube but I&# ;m not sure if he&# ;ll be able to jump straight up to get on top of the tube. I&# ;m keeping his old cat tree next to the new one as a platform to jump off of for now but maybe he&# ;ll get more comfortable in the future. Overall I really like it and he will already jump onto the top of the tube if he&# ;s interested in a toy up there and I&# ;ve found him napping on the middle and perch once already.\n
 This condo is covered in real carpet which is easier for cats to dig into when climbing.  It has multiple layers for lounging.  The base is not heavy enough for free standing.  It needs to be wedged under a piece of furniture, like a sofa, to keep it from falling over when cat jumps high.  I have ours up against the wall between the tv table and a bookcase.  With a heavier base shipping would cost more, so I am happy with my purchase :)\n
 Very well made. It&# ;s nice and heavy so no fears of my 16-18 lb cats knocking it over. I needed something for older cats. Not tons of little hiding spaces and toys dangling. I especially needed platforms large enough. So many cat trees cater to kittens. But what about when your cat is full grown and won&# ;t fit in the houses, hammocks or on the multiple small platforms??  I highly recommend this tree. It was also extremely easy to assemble. You will probably need help getting the box in the house and out of the box.\n
 I like the carpet and it feels sturdy. My cats wanted to jump on it as soon as they got done playing in the box it came in!  But it arrived oken. The hardware for the top platform is bent and smashed in so I can&# ;t attach it. It&# ;s built in to the platform so I can&# ;t even replace it. My cat tower is now 55&#8221; tall. It&# ;s very heavy so is it even worth it to box back up and haul to ups to return? This one took weeks to get here as it is.\n
 I was so happy this came in three pieces and I just had to screw them together. The height is perfect for my home and my cats, and I really like the color too. It&# ;s very sturdy and is made of good quality materials.\n
 I have 12-year-old cat and 13-year-old cat and within 10 minutes of assembling the cat tree they were all over it one of the reasons I got it is because it has some low platforms so it would be easier for the older cat but he was able to get up to the top easily. It took about 10 minutes to assemble it and it seems quite sturdy I would definitely recommend this kind of cat tree using solid wood and real carpeting means that it should hold up for quite a long time.\n
 &#160;I like that it\'s real carpet, my cat enjoyed it right away. It does wobble alittle, due to carpet just folded under and stapled on the bottom. If carpet the whole bottom, wouldn\'t wobble. I like it alot, but very pricey.\n
 The cats love it!  Gave 4 stars because of the cheap carpet.  After 2 days I have a pile of carpet shreads at the bottom.  Carpet won\'t last long. I would gladly have paid more money for good carpet.\n
 &#160;Bad quality, they used the cheapest carpet, color is different than on pictures, and after two months it&# ;s oken\n
 Quality of the rug is very disappointing compared to others we&# ;ve owned especially considering the price.  They aii shed tufts as the cats scratch so I was willing to over look it, hoping it would decrease over time.  However, other problems have ensured and the tower is now out doors, on the back porch. We are awaiting information on blood work as the cat appears to be allergic to something in/on the tower.\n
 Bought for my son&# ;s very active cat. That cat loves this tree! They have a very high window ledge and this tall tree is perfect! He can lie in comfort and monitor the neighborhood or easily transition to the window ledge if he needs to.</>Easy to put together and sturdy. Great product!!\n
 The New Cat Condo cat tower is very well made.  Sturdy wood construction covered in strong carpet.  Well worth the price.  I expect this to last years!\n
 This cat condo is very sturdy &amp; solid.  The carpeting is attached well &amp; isn\'t peeling off the posts.  My previous condo was shredded after a week or two.  This one has held up very well &amp; my three cats love it\n
 Well built and sturdy. My cat loves the height and spent almost all day on it the minute my husband put it together.  He gets very possessive and doesn\'t want us coming near his castle!  He likes to swat at us through the window in the tunnel.\n
 I was in paradise it was so easy to install\n
 Easy assemble after I got the big box inside(heavy).  Unit is very sturdy and durable.  Cats love and it is holding up very well.  It did not come with a safety strap for securing to a wall.  Great value for the price.\n
 This cat tree has great carpet, solid wood, and easy assembly.  Had a wicker basket nice cat tree but cats did not like it so I sent it back.  Cats love this carpet which is plush with only minor strands (4) that were easily cut off.  This cat tree is basically one unit with the upper loft attached by twirling to the post.  The tree was well packaged, weighed about 50 pounds.  There were no missing parts and alignment was true.  My cats were on this tree within 30 seconds after assembly.  It seems stable and the circular loft is about 17 inches, which is big enough for my 20 pound grey and white fluff ball.  There is carpet underneath the circular loft, which is about 32 inches from ground and will reach window pane. There were no strong odors.  Prestige Cat trees are well made and will last forever.\n
 This cat tree doesn&# ;t allow enough spacing or offset for my cat to comfortably jump from one shelf to the other.  My cat is only four years old and quite a climber so I imagine if she&# ;s having issues a lot of other cats will too.  Frankly I would return it if my husband hadn&# ;t already disposed of the shipping box.\n
 I have two very active kittens. I bought another cat tree for them and I was always worrying that they\'d tip it over. When I saw this one on line I immediately realized it would be much more stable. It\'s great! They can wrestle all they want on it, jump from the top to the top of bookcases, or just plain sleep comfortably curled up together. I love it and so do they.\n
 My cat loves his climbing towers. He has recently showing signs of arthritis in his back legs. Having multiple levels has made it so much easier for him to still climb up to the top where he likes to be. Very sturdy also which helps a lot since he&# ;s 15 lbs and very long.\n
 I have a rather large cat and some of the cat trees do not have a sturdy base. This cat tree is made very well and attractive . Very pleased\n
 I see pictures from customers of the tree with beautiful carpeting from a few years ago and mine is not that. If you purchase it now they have switched out the beautiful plush carpeting for carpet so cheap I wouldn&# ;t even put it in my garage. I have been buying cat trees from Prestige and New Cat condos for years and both companies have gone way down on the quality of carpeting on the trees. Did they think we as the consumers would not notice this?! Is carpeting that much money that you can&# ;t put plush high quality carpeting on the trees like you advertise yet still charge us the same high amount?!? Order from either of these companies and you will see for yourself. I never write reviews but I felt I had to here.\n
 Easy to assemble.  Wish it was a little larger.\n
 One of the best and solid cat posts I&# ;ve ever owned!!  It is sturdy and won&# ;t fall over!!\n
 I needed something strong enough for my 15 lb cat and her super active other. This cat tree fits the bill!\n
 Liked very much\n
 I\'m usually lazy about reviews but am writing in hopes of helping more products like this flourish in the market, because we really need more of this stuff. My dislike of carpet and faux fur limits my options greatly, and this cat tree is a godsend.</></>- The gray slate wood is lovely and looks better than most human furniture in my house. Not only is it beautiful, but it\'s also more affordable than most other carpet-free cat trees that are simpler in design. For the price, this is an incredibly high quality piece of furniture to spoil your cat with, and even comes with a full sized screwdriver and easy-to-follow IKEA-style instructions.</></>- Unlike most cat trees that have open top perches, the rounded and walled top perch on this cat tree allows my cat to curl up and lean safely. The hanging toy is a bonus that allows the lazy cat to become a little more active.</></>- Kudos for the little pad you can velcro onto the wood surface so the cat doesn\'t get cold while we still get pleasing aesthetics. The faic has the pleasant feel of flannel pajamas.</></>- The bottom box is quite low, and comes equipped with a thick, fluffy cushion - perfect for an aching senior cat. Bonus points for the cushion being removable.</></>- The proportions are well balanced; minimal lines, tucks nicely against your wall or corner, offers plenty of height without being overwhelming, while packing very diverse resting areas -- a safe little nest to snuggle in, an open space to groom and lounge, and a top perch to curl up or bird watch. It meets all my cat\'s needs and she stopped using any other bedding.</></>- Each resting surface (top perch, velcro pad, box) fits a petite cat with a bit of room to spare. For our 8lb cat this is a deluxe condo with plenty of surface area, but if your cat is 22lb, it\'s gonna be a tighter fit.</></>- One of the side boards to the enclosed box came with a deep crack that threatened to eak off the entire length of the box. We stabilized it by putting the other parts together and fastening them to hold it in place. But if not for this workaround, we would have had to go through the hassle of a return process after having spent half an hour dealing with the assembly, and the frustration would have dampened our spirits about this considerably.</></>- Some of the holes for the screws were not uniform.</></>- Due to its many parts, it\'s inevitably less stable than a solid piece of furniture. The highest perch, for example, wobbles a bit when my cat moves.\n
 My cat took to this tree immediately, and spends a lot of time snoozing on the top perch. It looks exactly as advertised and is very aesthetically pleasing. I was able to assemble it relatively quickly, and I am not talented in putting things together at all. I actually got a few things wrong at first, and was still able to get it all put together in about an hour. It\'s sturdy, doesn\'t wobble at all when she hops onto or climbs it (and yes she has climbed the scratching post a few times), and the dangle toy is still intact! So far, she hasn\'t used the cubby yet, aside from poking her head in at first exploration, but it takes her a bit to take to enclosed places.</></>Overall, a very nice looking cat tree/condo if you\'re looking for something of a more reasonable height and have a single cat.\n
 I do not enjoy and am not good at putting furniture of any kind together. If I found it easy to assemble you will too. I was happy it included a screwdriver. My kitty is declawed so she doesn\'t use the scratching posts. She is 13-14 pounds and it is sturdy. She loves the toy it came with (there is an extra one included which is nice). The color is what you would expect.  All the positive reviews made me purchase it and I am very happy with it! The measurements are accurate. I think it an excellent value for what it costs.\n
 Absolutely love this cat tower! Wanted to buy something a little shorter to be placed in front of a window for my cats to people watch. They took to it really quickly and have really loved sun bathing on it during the day. I think it&# ;s a great size overall to give them plenty of space. It&# ;s very ascetically pleasing which I love compared to a lot of other towers. The one thing I would say for construction- the piece of the cubby with the hole for them to get in (at least for me) was cut so that it had to be put in a specific way to fall flush with the rest. It&# ;s a square piece but I guess not technically even. I don&# ;t think it was mentioned in the instructions there was a certain way to slide it so then I just realized that turning it and putting it in differently was what to do. So not a big deal at all but just something to know if putting your piece in the first time makes it not fall flush.\n
 This was very easy to put together. Did it in a 1/2 hour. The second I finished, my cat got up from where she was and jumped into the cubby hole. The height is perfect for my window which is 40&#8221; from the floor. She also uses the scratching posts regularly. I like that it isn&# ;t made of carpet. The base  and top perch are made of faic but won&# ;t leave carpet fibers all over. The cushion for the cubby hole is a little flat so I just put in a blankie on top of it to make it softer. Happy cat. And isn&# ;t that all that really matters?\n
 I like this thing. It was easy to assemble, it looks perfect in my house. My cat is 4 y.o and  has never had anything like this before, so he was freaking out for a little bit, but started liking it very soon.\n
 It&# ;s sized for kittens. My cats don&# ;t fit in the cubby or on the top shelf. It&# ;s not comfy or enticing so they don&# ;t use it at all. It looks better than most cat trees but not useful or practical\n
 &#160;I&# ;m am just thrilled with this product it&# ;s the purrfect gift for my two new kitties. They play on it all the time. They were hiding under furniture often before I got it. I also love they won&# ;t scratch on my furniture as much. My 15 year old granddaughter put it together easily. it&# ;s so pretty. I read the reviews on many other one looked very cool but had a review saying a cat got its paw stuck in it. this is the best bang for the much and love the contemporary look.\n
 This product is VERY well made.  The materials aren\'t cheap -- they went above and beyond making this product.  They include a full-sized screw driver to help you assemble the product.  I had a lot of fun building this cat tree!  It\'s cute and fits well with my furniture.</></>My cat hasn\'t taken to it yet -- she is more of a burrower than a climber.  I just needed something for her to scratch on and possibly get used to hanging out on it than laying in my new recliner and scratching that up.  :)\n
 This is a great product! Very easy to put together, and it comes with everything you need, even a screwdriver. The height of the top perch is perfect for my cat to look out the window. My cat is just under 10 pounds and fits perfectly in the cube and on the top perch. If your cat is much bigger than that, I would recommend finding another product. It\'s a tad wobbly, but pushing it against a wall was enough to stabilize it. The toy ball that comes with it entertained my cat for about an hour before she snapped it off. But still very much worth the price!\n
 I spent ages shopping around for a cat tree that was aesthetically pleasing, or at the very least, palatable to look at in my living room. My cat has FOMO very badly, and would never use a cat tree unless it was in the main living space. This tree is modern and cute, but blends in with my decor style. It was easy to build, I think it took 15 minutes and I was chit chatting as I worked on it. My cat is on the heavier side, but does fit in the top perch. If you have a large cat it might not be a comfy fit.\n
 Love the modern look of it, it is much more attractive than most cat trees. My two cats absolutely love it, and love that there are multiple places for them to lay comfortably. It is sturdy. My one cat who is rather fat loves the little box that she can crawl in and fit comfortably inside.\n
 Super cute, modern cat tree. We have a smaller sized cat who weighed (prior to the Covid) about 8lbs. She is compactly in the areas for her and she has enjoyed it since putting it together. Our 11 year old son, who loves anything to do with building or tools, put it together with ease.  Looks great, just as the picture and we are pleased with the purchase as it goes well with contemporary decor.\n
 I first bought this cat tree and then also bought a taller one by the same company. The quality of both is great and they are super easy to assemble! The cubby is on the smaller side and fits one cat great but is a little tight for two, even tho my older kittens still smoosh themselves in there. Highly recommend this!\n
 Most cat trees have never been updated in style. This is one of the few modern looking ones.</></>Super easy to assemble. Someone with basic skills could probably do it without having the instructions in hand... it\'s that easy to figure out.</></>I like the removable pad and pillow... Makes cleaning MUCH easier than the carpeted ones.</></>VERY happy.\n
 Our kitten absolutely loves this cat tree. He loves jumping up each flight and laying on the top perch looking out the window. The only annoying part was it came slightly damaged (see attached images) with a chip in the wood, right in the front of the tree in perfect view. We waited so long for it to arrive we didn\'t want to spend all of the time it would take to return it and purchase a new one. Otherwise, it\'s great.\n
 Okay, so the baby girl absolutely loves it and actually uses all parts lol.  I would have like it to been taller but just stacked it on something I already had and added some of her favorite pillows and rest things.  She place with the having ball thing every single time she jumps up onto it, multiple times a day.  She will spend hours sleeping there.  Seriously. See image\n
 &#160;I placed it in the bedroom for access to the chest &amp; window.</>My 20lb boy enjoys it.</>He sleeps in the top part, too.</>My other 11y.o cat does not use it.</>Wish it was a bit shorter for her to jump on.\n
 my cat really loves this tree. it\'s super sturdy (she\'s 10lbs) and she loves to play with the little ball on it. she\'s a little big for the top round perch but she doesn\'t seem to mind as she\'s always up there lol\n
 Great little cat tree for the price. I was able to put the pedastal on the opposite side which was nice.\n
 My persian boy loves his new tree/ condo as we call it. So chic and we\'ll made. He loves the top round bed he lies in it more often than the box near the bottom even his fat Garfield lookin self kinda hangs off the sides a little haha he gets the zips and climbs up and attacks the toy. And I love how the toy screws in and comes with an extra toy as well.\n
 I really liked that it was modern looking and not covered in all that outdated beige carpeting stuff, either. My little fella was climbing all over the kitchen counters, so wanted to get him something else to climb and this has done the trick so far. Unfortunately, he doesn\'t use the enclosure, though, so I wish there was an option for another scratching post and shelf or something else in it\'s place. However, regardless, it was still a great find and I\'m very pleased with it.\n
 This product is pretty cool. Nice cat furniture, with fun modern appeal. Easy to put together. Relatively sturdy,  jury is still out on the top platform. But our 2 yr old cat loves to sleep up there and its holding good so far. Our kitten likes the bottom. :-)\n
 It was easy to put together (very similar to other furniture assemblies). I have two cats and they have both enjoyed it very much. It&# ;s more modern looking and the perch seems to be the favorite thing. If I could change one thing, I would want the cat scratching posts to be slightly thicker in diameter, but they still use it.\n
 I was really excited pulling the pieces out of the box. This is the most modern and simple cat tree I&# ;ve come across and I was delighted as I assembled the pieces. Unfortunately it wasn&# ;t until the very last piece (top perch) that I was disappointed the hole was too big for the screw so it can&# ;t screw into place. I am now left with an awkward cat tree ;(\n
 My cat is finally relaxed.  My puppy irritates my cat so bad she was running out of places to jump on. I ought her this and she\'s in love...it sits by our screen door so she can look out at nature and don\'t have to worry about our puppy.\n
 My cat loves this! We have a small apartment and wanted a cat tree to put in front of our window that wasn\'t too big or too much of an eyesore, and this accomplished that! Our cat likes sprawling across the second tier, and sitting on the top level to watch birds. She also loves the little ball! Great product, thanks for keeping our cat occupied!\n
 Easy to assemble. Sturdy as all heck. Came with clean parts, everything setup nice. Couldn\'t be happier with this purchase. Perfect for my young cat, she loves it!\n
 The cat tree was super easy to assemble. Everything was labeled and the instructions were clear. I like the modern take on the cat tree, really blends in with my furniture. Doesn&# ;t take a lot of space and my cats really like the resting hole.\n
 My cat likes it. I wanted something smaller and modern. The cushion on the top is a little small. Overall it has a clean look. My cat is used to a tall bigger one but, this was a good compromise for a new one in my apt.\n
 Bought for my upstairs. Cats really like it. I forgot to click on the $5 off coupon, so don&# ;t forget!\n
 My cat loved putting it together. Although now he just visits it but he does use the scratcher all the time.\n
 Well made, perfect for bigger cats.. our fatty loves it!\n
 So amazing</>I LOVE the look</>I love theres no ugly Carpet</>So cute</>Really really amazing material</>Even comes with a screwdriver and extra of EVERYTHING\n
 The lone tower piece makes me cat feel a little uncertain when she gets up there, not her favorite place. But overall I love the look and design of this.\n
 MY cat loves it and I\'m so glad I made the purchase. Sturdy materials with sleek design. I think it\'s a great value and now want to purchase another. It just blends right into my decor and gives my baby a place to get away from the doggies.\n
 It took a little while to assemble but it was pretty easy. My Bengal and Ocecat love it! &#128571;&#128571;\n
 The thing oke in half after only a few months of use! Scared my cat and my toddler  when it oke too!\n
 I wanted something that looked a little more modern and had the colors of our living room. This was perfect! The cats seem to really like it!\n
 This cat tower was just the right height. My kitten loves to look out the window on the highest tower bed. It was fairly easy to assemble, I would use a drill to really screw everything in to add to the sturdiness. My cat loves it and the color is great and modern.\n
 so easy to put together, came with all the tools and parts as well as some extra pieces and a replacement ball toy! My cat is obsessed.\n
 Absolutely LOVE this. So happy with my purchase. Very sturdy and only took 15/20 mins to assemble!\n
 As soon as I completed putting the tower together my cat made it her own. Perfect size for my apartment. I didn&# ;t use the circle opening for the cube but left it open. Also attached a piece of sisal to the outside of the cube for an additional scratching area.\n
 Sleek, sturdy, and functional.\n
 My 7 pound cat loved the tower. After several weeks, the seat tower became wobbly. My daughter tried to tighten it and the cardboard structure under the scratch post oke. This made the seat tower useless.\n
 Our vacate love it. Comfortable extension of their window view\n
 This is a beautiful cat tree. My 2 cats love it. Very sturdy and the price was fantastic. Definitely recommend.\n
 It looks really good after assembly. It is easy to assemble and my cat immediately started using. She isn\'t a large cat so I\'m not sure how the tallest stand would be for a bigger cat. She enjoys hanging her head off and sleeping.\n
 Super pretty! My cat loves the felted material! Doesn\'t look like a cheap carpet!\n
 My 5 lb kitty loves this piece. She perches to watch the birds and naps in it during the day and at night. I like the scale for a small cat and the more modern design works well in my bedroom.  It is very well made.\n
 This was super easy to assemble and a the best looking cat tower I&# ;ve come a cross. I would definitely recommend!\n
 This is a very well made cat tree.  Easy to assemble.  The cat loves it!\n
