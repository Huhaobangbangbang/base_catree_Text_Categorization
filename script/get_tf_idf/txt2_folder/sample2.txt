Wouldn\'t get if you have a bigger cat.\n
 Love the way the cat home looks. Simple/minimalist. Cat loves it. Easy to assemble. Sturdy.\n
 If you&# ;ve ever assembled anything from IKEA you&# ;ll be fine. Easy to assemble. They even gave you a screwdriver for assembly and a few extra parts. Very pleased and the cat loves the box the tree came in. Lol!\n
 Easy to assemble. Well packaged. Great cat tower.\n
 Super happy with mod design for this cat tree/scratching post! Five meow&# ;s for sure.\n

 Easy to set up. Cat loves it and it&# ;s pretty much where she&# ;s at all the time now.\n
 My older cat and kitten love it, there can use it at the same time to look out the window at the bird feeder\n
 This is a very nice looking cat "tree". It takes about 30 mins. to throw it all together. They even included extra parts. Also an extra hanging toy! Its very sturdy and well made. One caveat is that the back support on the top seat was a little bent in; from the way it was packaged; but not enough to warrant returning it and really not that noticeable. Its cardboard or something else like that. They probably figured anything else might crack in the shipping. The best thing is that this fits in my small kitchen and Sparkles my 5lb. kitty can stay out from underfoot. Last but certainly not least is that the minute she saw it she climbed into the "box". She sat there awhile and then jumped up and inspected the rest. She tried out the toy and presently is "perched" up top. She was  watching but is now sleeping from up there as we eat dinner. She immediately took to it and so did we! Not too small or too big. Just the right size and she has plenty of room to grow and it will still accommodate her!</>P.S. Update...The backrest I spoke about is covered with faic and the "bend is slowly coming out over time. She absolutely loves the top perch and would spend the entire day sleeping up there if she didn\'t need to come down for food, water or the litter box. Btw the other day I was about 6 feet away and on the phone and she rolled over in her sleep and fell off the perch backwards and hit the floor before I could catch her. She was dazed but fine. I just wish there was a "safety net or bar" across the open side of the perch. So I\'m glad that this cat "tree" is no taller than it is. Height is something to think about when you buy one of these :)\n
 The package was lost in the mail and the seller responded promptly and followed up regularly to see what I wanted to, eventually sending me a replacement free of charge. Very happy with the customer service!!</></>My kitten loves the cat tower. He started using it immediately. After scratching the posts myself he also started scratching them. He loves running up and down it when he is playful, and sleeps on the bed at the top. So far he isn&# ;t very into the enclosed box but I&# ;ll try to get him into it with treats and toys. Pleasing to look at too, blends in well with my modern, minimalist style. Not an eye sore like most cats beds!\n
 This cat tower is of great quality and very well constructed. My cats enjoy it every day and I am pleased with my purchase. It is a little smaller than I was expecting but that doesn\'t detract from the quality or my recommendation - just something to consider.\n
 I\'m very happy with this purchase. It\'s well built, easy to assemble, and my kittens love it.\n
 I appreciate the visual aesthetic as well as it having no carpeted surfaces.  Assembly was simple, but time consuming. Fairly sturdy, though it\'s only been in use less than a month; only time will l tell....\n
 So it came as shown in picture. Honestly it was not that difficult to figure out what goes where. With a picture of the product from my phone and the instructions included it took me maybe 45 minutes. It is pretty sturdy but some of the fur does come off during install. I just used a lint roller and rolled the whole thing. I took a little catnip I had and rubbed it all over. My cats seem to enjoy it and I have 3 total. 2 adult cats and a new kitten and it holds all of them. The white strap is to attach it to a wall which a screw and anchor is included.\n
 I just put this together, and in less than 30 mins. We used to have a taller one but my husband didn\'t want as much of an eye sore this time, so I went with this one that was medium sized. It will work well and was the best priced for it\'s features and ease of assembly. The only real difference between this and the taller ones is maybe one of the attachments on top standing a little taller. My fatty cat (pictured) checked it out immediately and played with the hanging ball, went to scratching the post, and crawled inside the little box with his fat self. He stepped onto the hammock but didn\'t stay in it. He may be questioning it holding his weight or just not interested at the moment. Truth be told, my adult cats will use it,  but it\'s perfect for kittens because of the short height between each level, making it easy for them to climb hide and play.\n
 The quality of this product is pretty okay. We have a kitten who likes it but it definitely would not be super stable for a larger or heavy cat. I can see it flipping over with more weight in the little hammock or from the force of a bigger cat jumping off the top.</>Building it is sort of difficult. The instructions are pictures, which is fine, but getting the pieces lined up/screwed together takes some patience. Probably took about an hour and the little cubby/house piece could not be mounted as described because the holes were improperly drilled. I just mounted it with the doors to the front and outside, instead of front and facing into the rest of the tree. Took about an hour to put together.\n
 I would like to give this a higher rating but there are a few issues with this.  The unit itself is not bad; it is not quite as big as I thought it would be; I can\'t see anyone buying this if they have a larger cat.  Mine is perhaps 8 lbs at the most; she has shown no interest in this at all, after having if for a few days.  i even sprayed it with a catnip infused spray but that has not enticed her to this.  Now as far as the instructions - forget it!  They are basically useless.  Pull up the pictures on Amazon so that you can see how to put it together.  I am still hoping my kitty will someday take an interest in this; then I will consider the item a better rating.\n
 I&# ;ll start off w/ the positive, cause i honestly still love the cat tree. It&# ;s really cute, I love the color which is a smoky grey or something like that. Now the negatives, I&# ;m missing the hanging bed on the side. Also as I was unboxing it, the pieces weren&# ;t the same, exactly as the product shown. Which as you can see it&# ;s slightly different. I&# ;m not mad that it&# ;s a little different, but I do wish it would have came w/ that bed, so that was disappointing. Also the instructions were terrible. It took me over an hour to figure this out, or maybe it was just me. But there was little to no info on the instructions. Other than that, it&# ;s a cute cat tree. But I do wish I had the product shown, w/ the hanging cat bed, w/ better instructions.\n
 First off the directions if you want to call them that were awful. It was super hard to tell what was going on. Second it was missing 2 screws to put it together. Ended up returning and paying a little more for a good quality one at petsmart.\n
 The little barn kitten turned house kitten needed her own space. She went WILD for this tree. Its the perfect size for one cat. Easy to assemble...took about 15 minutes. And it gives her multiple scratching posts and places to lay, or pounce on the dog. Definitly needed this! Price was right, and same day delivery! &#128077;\n
 My cat is 12 lbs and this item is just the size for her to sit on to look out the window. I&# ;d recommend leaving the hammock part off though, but that might just be my cats preference. She has NO intention of sitting in that part. It is quite sturdy and I like the removable/washable ring on the top.\n
 Cute but better for smaller cats. My cat in photo is full grown but only 5.11 pounds (runt!) My bigger cat will sit on tip for a few to look out window but not much otherwise. The scratch posts are 2 small for an aduot cat to scratch. But.. Great for kittens/small cats.\n
 I received my package today. We love it. My cat Aero just has to get use to it. He doesn\'t think it\'s his yet lol\n
 Love it, I think I like it more than the cat. I got it in the light grey and blends in with the colors in the living room. Is really easy to assemble and the cat likes the different places where she lays. if you don\'t use the screw to attach to the wall so it doesn\'t fall, be careful though. It\'s sturdy but if she jumps from all the way in the top,it\'s gonna move away from the wall and look like it\'s gonna fall.\n
 This is definitely affordable and overall easy to put together. Except for the 4 interior poles to the hiding space. Those are impossible to get to line up. Once those are in you are all set. Good for our new kitten. Shorter than I expected, but good for now.\n
 Had it for over a month now. My month old kitty has outgrown the top part, she&# ;s hanging off now.</>Top part is also wobbly now; not as tightly screwed in anymore. Easy assembly and she loves to play on. Not idea for an adult cat, they&# ;ll outgrow it\n
 I really was excited when this arrived. But they sent me the  wrong model and i don\'t care for it. I wanted the one as i ordered and with the hammock. Now its already put together so I\'m keeping this one.. the material is ok. But there is no cushion at all to the " house" part or any of the parts cat would lay on. Its quite hard. I\'m going to cut out sections of plush carpeting to put down.\n
 A part-Siamese kitten has been on it for two months and it&# ;s still standing.  Much cheaper than what we found in local stores and seems to measure up.\n
 Within minutes of assembly one of my cats jumped right in and obviously loves it. My other cat, not so much but I think that&# ;s just a matter of time. He was playing with it when I was putting it together so I think he&# ;ll warm up to it.</>Assembly wasn&# ;t hard and I had it together pretty quickly. I don&# ;t think this tree would work for larger cats though, but for smaller cats it&# ;s perfect.\n
 Directions aren\'t great, but I did it and I\'m an almost 80 year old woman. Seems quite sturdy. I like the size.\n
 Doesn\'t come with all the appropriate hardware. Now I have to go to ACE and spend more money!</></>EDIT: I do not recommend this product for a rambunctious 5 month old kitten. It is not very stable, even up against the wall. Our kitty has this rocking like crazy when he gets his zoomies. Hasn\'t knocked it over yet but pretty sure he will eventually.</></>Final edit: screws are coming lose, my kitten has knocked it over more times than I can count! NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE EFFORT!!@\n
 This took a while to assemble and the directions were less than adequate. But it looks good and , if my cat ever decides to use it, I&# ;m sure she&# ;ll enjoy it.\n
 Cheaply made. Cheap lightweight cardboard wood so it doesn&# ;t stay up. Have to put weights on the bottom of mine so when my cat jumps up on it, it doesn&# ;t fall over on him. Which as happened multiple times. The top purch is very wobbly and it will never be sturdy how much I tighten the bolts. Not worth what they have it priced at. Only reason I give it two stars is bc it does look like the pic.\n
 First - the tower is well made and easy enough to put together.  I purchased it for a rescue cat we had just adopted.  I was excited to receive this tower because it wasn\'t too tall/large ( for my office ) but had a large enough platform bed for her to sleep on, and a "basket" which on reviews of other towers seemed to be cat\'s favorite part.  She\'s not an overly large cat - 10 pounds, but the configuration of the top square platform ( not shown in my pictures we removed ) did not give her enough room to get to the hanging ball to play with or comfortably move from one level to the next, so we removed it.  After a month and a half of her not paying any attention to the basket, we also removed that and eventually added more sisal so she can have a taller location to scratch on.  She only uses the pole to scratch, not the ramp ( another feature I thought was great ); loved the hanging ball ( until she overstretched it too many times and snapped it off ); rarely goes in the house - but does.  Loves the platform bed and its large size ( many other towers I saw had smaller ones ) allows her to be cozy but comfortable . Every cat is different - so yours may love some of the features that mine did not.  I think the key takeaway is how large your cat is and will this be functional for them.  It was a good price so I didnt think making the adjustments detracted from the positives about it\n
 My cat would not get on it at first. He\'s about 14 pounds and it was hard for him to go from the box to the platform. He hated the bed and wouldn\'t step in it. I ended up taking the bed off which made it easier for him to sit on top of the box and jump to the platform. He will only go on it every now and then. Hopefully he\'ll get use to it.</>I loved everything else about it.\n
 I originally got this as a gift for another cat, but I should have read the description more closely. This condo is very small; we jokingly call it "a cat tree for ants". I kept it rather than go through the hassle of returning it, but I should have just returned it. It suits my small cat just fine, she\'s a bit over seven and half pounds, but she has already pulled the mat up out of the scratch post entry thing. She isn\'t that strong so that says a lot about the quality... It\'s great for the price, I suppose, so I won\'t complain.\n
 I have two new kittens (2 months old) and this tree/condo is perfect for them. Not too high to eak a leg jumping off, not too low to be boring. They both sleep inside the rectangle cubby hole.  One of them loves the bowl and the other loves the cushy tray above the bowl. Perfect viewing platform for looking out the window at birds and chipmunks.  If you have kittens, this is a great tree for them!\n
 I love this cat tower!  Tower looked exactly like the online picture after assembled, was pleased....My cat went right to it after it was set up, and placed by my living room window.  She&# ;s an adult, only 2, and not a big cat...on the smaller average size, and she seems to fit just fine on all the perches and in the house part.  She loves to look out the patio window on her new tower perches!  It&# ;s so soft and mostly sturdy, just a teenie weenie bit wobbly, but not bad.  I like the ladder part so she can either climb or scratch on it.  I don&# ;t know who likes it more, me or her lol, but all in all, it&# ;s great and worth the money:)\n
 Love the color love the style but very difficult to put together as you can see in the pictures the post are crooked where we had to bend them to screw them in. The bottom post even cracked a lil ok the bottom piece. And the long one in front is at an angle so that it could be screwed In too. My baby is only 10 weeks old so it&# ;s fine for now but I feel like the bigger she gets it won&# ;t hold up.\n
 Looked good when unpacking, not so much when trying to put together. Screw holes didn\'t line up instructions were not very clear when assembling, is was a cat toy not a piece of furniture. So sent back.\n
 Product is easy to assemble and is sturdy and reliable. This is the longest scratch post that my cats have had. It is a great purchase for the value. Will buy again!\n
 Very upset with this product. Have only had it for 2 months and screws have been coming loose and falling out. The assembling was not easy at all took me atleast 5 hours. Definitely not worth the price and do not recommend this product. Please anyone look around first before you choose any type of cat tower. You need to have alot of patience to put these things together.\n
 Had bought another one that had smaller perches. My large cats were hanging off. This one is much better and doesn\'t wobble around like the other one.\n
 Very inexpensive and my cats love it\n
 This was quick and easy to assemble and is great for both my small and larger cat\n
 Perfect size for average mid-size cats and kittens alike. Purrfect the!\n
 My two furbabies love it and it is soft and easy to put together.\n
 The photos here misleading- the tree is alot smaller in person. This seems like for kittens.\n
 Thought it would be more sturdy and taller\n
 I love the product!  Just a pain in my ass to put together! Be prepared to have a drink or 10!\n
 Easy to assemble for the most part. Directions were vague but useful.</>The cats love it. Came with a few extra bolts and an extra ball toy.\n
 This is so small that even a petite cat can&# ;t use! For six months and younger.</>Complete waste of money!!\n
 We buy things to make our pets happy, right? This was another &#8216;hope they like it&# ; kind of thing. They absolutely love it! Best purchase we have made for our cats!\n
 This cat tree is SO adorable and very soft in person - the only problem is that my cat is WAY too big for it. It\'s much shorter and smaller than the photos make it seem. Ideal for a kitten/young adult cat, but my two year old ragdoll is way too big for it and I will be (sadly) returning it.\n
 The bottom piece is actually two separate pieces that is only held together by the carpet. There was a washer that seemed to be an extra part as it wasn&# ;t shown on the instructions but I realized it was meant to support the bottom two pieces to keep from folding. Unfortunately, the bottom piece  is not strong enough to hold back the two pieces with just the washer and it pulled the material in half. I was able to reinforce the bottom with some boards I had but for the price, I expect much better quality. The second picture depicts how the tower ends up when my cat jumps off.\n
 UPDATE: The company reached out to me, concerned that the product I received had oken so easily and was unsafe for my cats. They promptly sent a replacement that had some helpful design changes. The replacement cat tree is far more stable and no longer wobbles all over the place when my cats jump up on it. So far the little flower perches have held up this time and my cats are throughly pleased to have their bedroom cat napping spot restored.</></>I wanted to love this cat tree. My cats wanted to love this cat tree. You see, they were several months overdue for new Kitty trees and toys so I ordered them a flurry of goodies here on Amazon, including this cat tree.</></>We had high hopes. However due to the way this cat tree is constructed (the bottom piece folds in half, held together only by the carpet and a bolt inconveniently placed at the center of the two pieces) it wobbles and sways more than a drunk person at a frat party.</></>Furthermore, the smaller yellow flower ledge also snapped in half when one of my cats jumped up on it. His name is Fred, he is very conscious about his figure so imagine his dismay when he jumped up and the ledge holding him snapped in half. Needless to say it didn&# ;t do much for his self esteem.</></>If I had time I would return this product. But alas, it&# ;s the holiday season and I think I may be several days past the return window now. That said, be aware that this product is clearly not worth the asking price, I&# ;ve seen better engineering from five year olds with legos.</></>Now, thanks to the failure of this cat tree to deliver a fun, sturdy perching/playing/napping option for my mini lions, my wife and our army of cats have convinced me that I must instead build new cat trees from scratch.\n
 Amazing and so cute! A little short, but fits perfectly in a corner or right next to the bed. My cats love it! My chunkier cat in the photo barely fits, but still loves to lay and sleep in it! I highly recommend!\n
 It is so cute but honestly the quality is trash. Our cats ( 3 ) tour this thing up faster then they do plastic bags. I mean, we have had a cat tree for 6 months and literally no damage even though they use it all the time, but this right here. Man, the bottom is made of cardboard, literally not figuratively.  I will probably transfer the posts to a piece of wood but that&# ;s not what I paid for the item to do. I wouldn&# ;t by unless you have a slow lazy cat that just sits, ours are young and do the most so that probably why it oke. We did have to add a planner ring to the bottom to make it work but it basically trashed.\n
 Let\'s start with the positives. It looks like it will be sturdy enough once we can get it assembled. The colors are viant. And the platforms definitely look like they will be comfortable for the cats. It comes with everything you need except detailed instructions? It has been extremely difficult just to screw the parts together. A piece was included in the Box that was not depicted on the instructions (an extra pedestal or possibly an extension to one of the pedestals?) And its use was not explained in the instructions. And not to sound Petty but it also smells weird like vinegar. Luckily my dad is good with tools so we\'ll see if we can try and get it together anyway.\n
 It is adorable but in no way stable. The base is in two pieces, held together by a piece of carpet. I ended up having to use gorilla glue to hold them together because it would rock and almost fall over when my cats jumped on it. Even after gluing the base together, the top platform is still very unstable. It leans to whichever side the cat is sitting, which means my cats rarely get on it.  You can see the lean in the attached picture (cat lured to perch with catnip).\n
 This is the cutest cat tower I\'ve ever seen! It\'s so much more colorful than most other cat towers, and has such a pretty, unique design. I\'d buy it even if I didn\'t have cats &#8212; it\'s that cute.</></>It was easy to assemble. It\'s on the shorter side when it comes to towers, but it\'s perfect for kittens. I can see my kitties outgrowing the perches as they grow bigger, but since it\'s not too tall, I hope they\'ll continue to use it when they\'re older and can\'t climb as high as they used to.\n
 My all cats love this tree. Will buy more !\n
 &#160;I was looking for something cute to go in my daughter&#8216;s room for the kitten. It is held together by a split piece of cardboard the cat is afraid to go on it because it is so unstable as shown by the video. We missed our return window so we&# ;re stuck with this flimsy thing.\n
 Great little cat tree, super stinkin cute. Cat wouldn\'t stay on it for the photo, even with cat nip!\n
 Most cat trees are too tall, or too wide, and definitely too ugly. :-) This one was not only super-cute, but also, we could mix and match the pieces to make it exactly fit. AAA+++\n
 Love this cat tree,tried buying it from Wish twice and they said it wasn\'t available after days of ordering it.This seller shipped super fast &#128578;very good quality cat tree.Thank you!\n
 My 10 lb cat enjoyed this cat tree for a couple of weeks. He played with the ball. He scratched the post. And I love the look of it. But, alas, he just went to get in it and bam. Over it fell with the bottom cracked. I\'m returning it and this time going for sturdy over cute.\n
 This was a great purchase for my kitty! I love that it is cuter than the typical cat tree and goes with my decor much better. It was really easy to assemble and is very soft. Good quality and well worth the price. Quick shipping. Thank you!\n
 It\'s been less than a year since I purchased and it is falling apart. Not steady, both of the flowers oke in half. I try super gluing but that didn\'t work! Disappointed. I\n
 I have 2 cats who both love this. It&# ;s small yet sturdy. Very easy to assemble. And it&# ;s cute!</>I would order again.\n
 I like this little cat tree a lot, however the base comes folded in half and relies on a washer and screw to keep it straight and stable. After a few weeks I noticed it folding up despite the washer. I think I\'m going to have to attach the base to a board to continue using it.\n
 but it smells so horrendous very strongly of what I\'m guessing wood? I did not like that I\'m literally writing this review in the middle of the night because the smell is stuck in my nose. I\'m sniffing a candle as I write this by the way. other than that my cat seems to like it and is already using it. It\'s also very cheaply made it doesn\'t look that way but once you put it together you can tell. if i could go back to the moment before I buy this i wouldn\'t buy it. thanks for coming to my ted talk\n
 This cat climbing frame has a reasonable design, complete structure and functions, the spacing between levels is right, and it also has the function of grinding claws. Cats like it very much. The installation is also very simple, with a small wrench attached to the shelf, it will be installed in ten minutes. The cat has a new home and jumps up and down, so happy!\n
 Cheap base is two pieces and designed badly, does not fit together very sturdy and collapses when the the tree falls due to instability.\n
 i&# ;ve had this cat tree for a month and it&# ;s already falling apart. the cardboard on bottom has separated from the carpet, so only the short purple flower can stand on it&# ;s own. i&# ;m going to replace the cardboard for wood, but repairs shouldnt be necessary for a $60 cat tree\n
 Super cute but very very flimsy. Doesn&# ;t hold up.\n
 Easy to assemble but much smaller than expected\n
 Very cute, but very small. My adult cat can fit on the orange seat but not the flowers. Definitely for small kittens.\n
 The tower was easy to assemble and so incredibly adorable, but the quality is nothing close to what i was expecting. The bottom piece oke almost immediately. Read the reviews AFTER purchasing and saw that this was happening to many people. Would not buy again !!!!!\n
 My cat tree didn&# ;t assemble. The tall tower either had a stripped screw, a missing piece, or the screw was too short. I contacted the company over 2 1/2 weeks ago with no response.\n
 Loved this cat tree when I I first viewed it. It was colorful and different. However, when I received it, it was a total disappointment.  The cat tree smelled terrible, it is very poor quality. This item should not be for sale at all. I usually do not write reviews, but felt I had to with this item.\n
 Great looking &amp; really easy assembly!\n
 It&# ;s very cute and relatively sturdy but my cat barely fits the bed. My cat is 1 year old and 10 lbs. She still likes to lay in it tho so I will keep it. She also loves the hanging ball.\n
 Cute little cat tree  My cat loves it\n
 The cardboard is cheap and snaps in half. It is flimsy and does not hold the cat\n
 Easy to put together and looks great! Cat loves the ball.\n
 this is a great cat tree! it&# ;s so cute and I love it! I also posted it on tik tok and it&# ;s absolutely blew up! I&# ;m so sorry if this inconvenienced you!\n
 That\'s all it took for these fur babies to have something new to scratch and play on. It was super easy to put together,came with everything I needed to put it together. As you can see it\'s already a fan favorite!\n
 Came fast, great seller!!\n
 This was very easy to assemble and my cat loved it from the start. It&# ;s colorful and goes with my eclectic taste.\n
 The bottom is not sturdy at all, my cat oke it in a few months. It completely snapped the bottom part in half, and now it won&# ;t stand at all. Would not buy.\n
 Love it so much it&# ;s so cute and easy to assemble, although the directions are wrong and you&# ;ll have to follow the picture to get what it should look like, the directions make it smaller and the picture makes it bigger!!\n
 my kitten loves this &amp; it&# ;s so cute! she doesn&# ;t sit on it but she loves playing with the hanging puff ball and using it as a scratching post!\n
 &#160;This item is mostly for a kitten. Too small eventually for a 1 year old cat\n
 East to assemble, but not very stable.  Better suited for cats under 10 lbs.  I do like the colors.  Not the same boring beige, own, or gray.\n
 This tree is too small for my average sized cats to fit in. It looks pretty good tho. It&# ;d be good for kittens.\n
 Pretty easy to assemble, it is really sturdy and now my kitten can look out the window. Kitty approved!\n
 Looks exactly like the picture very easy to put together and very cute!\n
 Very cute, but the based oke the first time the cat jumped off it. Not very stable either. Very wobbly.\n
 It&# ;s oke after a week\n
 This cat tree is cute but the spot where cats can lay is so small, a full grown cat will not fit on it\n
 Went together very easily. I wish thy did this design in a taller tree!\n
 My cat loves it. And so do I I&# ;m happy that I found a cat tree that was cute, functional, and it didn&# ;t eak the bank. Building it took me about 5 minutes and it was pretty self explanatory on what to do as well.\n
 I didn&# ;t get all the right screws so one of the pieces won&# ;t stand up straight and falls overs\n
 I had it for 2 weeks before my 3 lbs kitten oke it by jumping on it too hard. It&# ;s very flimsy. Will not be buying a new one.\n
 Unfortunately this only lasted about a week before one of the posts fell off and couldn&# ;t be put back\n
 Cheaply made, oke a month after having it. Would not recommend this item.\n
 I\'ve had it two weeks and the base already oke.\n
 Love the colors and tree itself but is a little flimsy and wish it was a little taller. Overall not bad.\n
 oke on the 3rd day\n
 My cat never played with it and when he did it oke\n
 So cute and kitty loves it\n
 So cute and my cat scratches it all the time. Just slightly unstable\n
 Kitties love it! Had to put a lil catnip on it to warm them up to it but they literally fight over it now.\n
 Super cute and pretty sturdy. Small tho, probably best for a kitten or small cat\n
 very small and not as sturdy as one would hope.\n
 Not sturdy at all and is very small\n
 Slumped &#128564;\n
 This cat tower is adorable! My cats were interested into it right away! Took me about 3 minutes to set up. Very easy to do. It\'s actually really stable aswell. The cats jumped on it and it stayed Still. The cats can now relax in peace on some beautiful flowers in the sky. Would definitely purchase again if I had more cats\n
 I saw all the great reviews. I was so excited, but what I got compared to everyone else&# ;s photos is not the same. Like they got name and and I got knock-off/returned product. The max height on mine is 20-21 inches- the description says 26&#8221;. I checked the instructions and did nothing wrong. The posts are so close together it was hard to get the flowers on. I had extra pieces?!</>It was easy to assemble and very cute, but I will be returning because this just really isn&# ;t what I ordered in terms of dimensions.\n
 &#160;This is such a cute little cat tree. Everyone who has stopped by the house has commented on how cute it is. When I moved recently a mama cat who was pregnant adopted me and then she had 4 kittens and we kept them all. This cat tree takes about 10 minutes to put together and it is very easy to assemble. It is soft and very well made. My kittens love it and jump all over it.\n
 &#160;I love how cute and very colorful this cat tree is. I chose this one as I thought the flower shape was adorable and I needed something for the cats to scratch and play with so they would stop scratching my furniture. They really enjoy batting the ball around and have enjoyed the scratching post. My cats are big boys but they still love this little scratching post! It&# ;s held up well and it was a very easy assembly.\n
 &#160;Quick and easy to assemble.  Came with easy to follow instructions.</>It is ight and colorful and our cat loves to snuggle in the top part. She\'s a fairly large cat and this is sturdy enough for her to scratch and climb all over\n
 This is an absolutely adorable spot for my kitty&# ;s to hang out!  They just love it. It&# ;s the perfect height to sit in front of the window so that the cats can watch outside.  Delivery was quick. Great price!  It was easy to put together. And my cats love it!  5 stars all around\n
 My fur babies LOOOVE it&#128571;&#128571;\n
 Well worth the money. The colors really catch my cats attention. Material is soft for napping.\n
 Great product for a great price! This tower is sturdier and easier to assemble than cat towers double the price. And the cats love it!\n
 Really cute. It is wobbly no matter how tight you screw the poles in. And it could\'ve been a bit taller for the price. But cats love it.\n
 This adorable cat scratcher is great for kittens 1st scratching post, the baby soft carpet, small platform and pompom are the perfect inviting space for kitty to play- compact and fits great in front of windows to give kitty a great view\n
 Just as described. Worked great! Nice quality and great value and price. Theses things are just perfect.\n
 baseboard oke within about 3 weeks. my cat was under 9 when we got this\n
 The description and other reviews were misleading. My cats are full grown and do not fit on the basket and barely can fit on the top perch. The basket is sized for a kitten. It is not sturdy. My cat was trying to get up it and it almost toppled over. The base is in 2 pieces which I feel is why it isn&# ;t sturdy. I am most likely going to return it and find a larger one.\n
 Its made like crap. Period, for the money, way to light tips over way to easy the fur is like, theirs nothing there, I would have sent this. Back, but it was put together, and a pain in the ASS TO SEND. BACK, IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY THIS CAT TREE DONT DO IT, I HAVE AN OKDWR ONE THATS HEAVY AND WELL CARPETED THICK AND COMFY FOR MY CATS, BUT DONT BUT THIS I CAN PICK IT UP WITH ONE HAND, WHO EVER MADE THIS POS, SHOULF BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES, THE ONLY THING IM GOING TO DO WITH IT, IS SET IT ON FIRE, NONE OF MY CATS LIKE IT AT ALL,, WHEN I SAW A TAG TO TIE IT TONTHE WALL, I KMEW THIS IS THE WORST THING I EVER. BOUGHT ON AMAZON, YOU GET A BIG FAT ZERO THE COMPANY WHO MAKES THIS POS\n
 Definitely worth the money. It&# ;s very soft and looks really nice - seems sturdy enough for my 18lb cat. The only thing I don&# ;t like is the bottom not connecting (the two pieces only connect via one screw on the top bed). It&# ;s a great size for big cats though! That was my main worry - but both my fatties will fit just fine!!\n
 &#160;Absolutely amazing!! I love it because it tall but not too tall AND I can rearrange it too!!! I love rearrange things! &#129392;&#128525;</></>P.S. it was a eeze to put together! I have carpal tunnel and I had no issues.\n
 OMG I love this tree! I lay on the top bed when I am trying to assess the bird population outside or trying to guess what the squirrels are doing. I use the enclosed bed to play with my owner who is fool enough to stick her hand into my space! Then the two toys are enjoyable in my spare time. My human wants me to use the scratching posts but I prefer  to hear her yell "stop that" when I sharpen my claws on the new couch.</>Owner review: The tree was easy to put together but did take a bit of time. It is very sturdy, strong base and low height.\n
 I bought this for my sister who recently adopted four little kittens. I wanted them to have a place to sleep and also to play. The kittens are in love with this. They jump on it, they sleep on it, they even have a little string hanging that they can play with.</>It did come a little big so you have to make room for it. We found the corner of the kitchen which is next to their food bowls and it&# ;s perfect for them. It&# ;s easy to move, it&# ;s sturdy. You won&# ;t be disappointed And your kittens will love it\n
 I got this to help spice up the containment area for these orphaned kittens the neighborhood feral cat had.  So far it is 100% successful.  It is a nice product and very well thought out and assembled with ease. All hardware was present and instructions were good enough to use for assistance to assemble it.\n
 &#160;This is a Christmas gift for our sweet baby, Safari! I tried to hide it until Christmas Eve at least but she saw it and I haven&# ;t been able to keep her away from it since! She&# ;s in love with it and so are we! Anything to make her happy&#129392; we love it!\n
 Great cat tree. Not so big that your friends and family suggest an intervention but big enough for the kids to have fun on. Was worried it may be too small but works good for fat cats and baby cats alike. Can be put in different configurations and is very sturdy the way we have the base. Even with hard landings there&# ;s no risk of tipping. Very solid construction and supports too. Highly recommend.\n
 I have had other cat trees but this one is very sturdy. A good yrre for kittens and older cats. I\'ve had another one that was very shaky and I gave to a kitten rescue and it was perfect. Easy and pretty self explanatory instructions. I put it together in about thirty minutes. It even has a strap to secure it to the wall which I probably won\'t use since I live on an apartment. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I will post a picture later.\n
 This cat tree offered the size and perch options I was looking for! Plus I dislike the fully carpeted models and this is way more attractive to look at. I only took one star off for the sharp corners on the cubby portion and it didn\'t include a stabilizing strap. I noticed the corners before I ordered so I also got corner protectors and problem solved!</>It\'s sturdy and roomy enough for my 16 lb. Maine Coon and I like that it has one section of scratch post tall enough for him to fully stretch and scratch. The top perch is the largest and he lays on it with legs dangling but that is what he prefers anyway.</>My petite lady loves the cubby but even the big guy gets in there. This is where I keep their toys too.</>Happy Camper Cats!!!\n
 It\'s attractive, it\'s got decent construction quality. I do have some concerns about the quality of the scratchers though. About 2 months in and Maude has thoroughly destroyed one of the posts, and is working her way through another. So I could wish that the sissal was more durable.\n
 Great buy. The cat definitely approves.  Been months and he still actually plays with the ball things.  Hardly wiggles at all when he jumps up there and he&# ;s 15 lbs.  The cat box thing is actually big enough for him to go in, and he does.  The other ones on standard cat trees were pointless because he couldn&# ;t fit. This is awesome because you can wash the pillow parts, they don&# ;t come off too easily so the cat doesn&# ;t slide around, and therefore doesn&# ;t hold any stench like standard cat trees.  Glad I tried this!\n
 Absolutely love this cat tree. I hate the carpeted ones as they end up looking so dingy and didn\'t fit in with my mid-century decor. I wanted something to blend in with my furniture and not stick out like a sore thumb but was also tall enough so the cat could escape the dogs. He loves this tree, and I was even surprised he crawled into the little box (he\'s a fairly large cat). Easy to put together, sturdy base and I get compliments all the time on it.\n
 The surface is too slippery as is for a cat to like it. I ended up putting carpet on all the wood surfaces and it\'s a little better. I doubt your cat will go in the box unless you put treats in there. The little toy on bungee cords is pretty worthless too. I would definitely buy something else or make your own. It does look nice though so if you don\'t have a cat and just want to waste some space go for it.\n
 Our cat loves this perch because of the height for looking out of the window and watching birds! We love this perch because of the removable/washable pads and the stylish look of it in the room (hard to find with a cat tree!) Highly recommend!\n
 So far we really like this tree. My cats love lying on the pillows and it seems very stable. I changed it around a bit to fit our needs and I love that it has no carpet.\n
 It was pretty easy to assemble and is very sturdy.</></>My cat still would rather sleep in the basket next to the tree than in the tree itself. However once she learned how to jump from the top platform to my bed one night at 1:46 am, she now knows how to get my attention for an early morning snack\n
 I did a lot of research trying to find a cat condo that is sturdy and easy to clean and was glad I came across this 1. Very stable, the pads can be removed to be washed in the machine, and it keeps my cat Mochi entertained when I&# ;m at work.\n
 The instructions were very vague, just pictures no guidance.  The padding is minimal, there are 4 pcs of faux fur pads that have 2 Velcro strips to hold them on.  The only good thing about this is that you can remove them and wash them.</></>The size is good for our 3 cats.\n
 This cat tower is very cheaply made. I purchased this and over the Vesper to save a little money. Bad idea! The one I was sent even had the holes drilled in the wrong spots so it could not even be put together properly. Had to send it back and will be ordering the more expensive and\n
 I would have rated this product high, except the company didn&# ;t send any wooden platforms!</>The delivery was surprising quick, the scratch post and washable mats were packaged nicely in the box but no wooden platforms. My cat seemed intrigued with the available contents but probably wondered why it was never assembled.</></>Probably not going to purchase from this company again.\n
 I wanted a cat tree that went with the aesthetic of my apartment and this was it! It was very easy to put together. My cat warmed up to it immediately. About a month later he still sleeps on it every night!\n
 Assembly was slightly difficult because the instructions were off and didn&# ;t match the given parts exactly. After a month of my cats using it, it became incredibly wobbly. Not worth the money.\n
 Nothing like you\'re cat getting zoomies, running up on this, and then almost falls off hanging on for dear life like Simba from The Lion King.</></>Other than that, super cute and my cat who is full grown can fit comfortably.\n
 finally a cat condo that is not an eyesore!\n
 Instructions not complete, you need to measure the scratch posts to determine accurate assembly.\n
 Great product. No doubt\n

 Looks nice very modern but wobbles a lot\n
 Love!\n

 My cat is more than 10 lbs and can stretch up to 3 ft so this is perfect. Compared to cat towers that are made of compressed saw dust, this is solid plywood so it is heavy and clearly sturdy. Not to mention that it has detachable soft touch furry cushions and not glued on surface that turns into a fur trap horror. Neat and tidy all round and is a strongly recommended purchase for big cat owners. It is unfortunate it is not 6 ft, but I cannot imagine this quality and heavy woodwork would be possible to get even larger/higher.\n
 Received wrong parts.  The short posts were taller than that stated on the parts sheet 39cm instead of 20.5, the longer posts were 45cm instead of 38.  Base was incorrect.  It had 4 holes drilled, instead of the described three.  Received 2 of part C and no part D.  Also missing both round rugs (part L).  We were able to make it work with a couple pieces of scrap 2x4s we already had but will have to go purchase a couple of carpet tiles to cover the wood. This was an epic fail!</></>That all being said, the materials were of good quality, but again, not all of the correct parts.\n
 Very easy for me to assemble, biggest thing is to lay everything out first then start. Fender\'s 14 pounds or there about and this has held up wonderfully. He can\'t shake it and it doesn\'t creak under his weight.\n
 I recommend this tree as a beginner tree for one or two small kittens, or a very calm and elderly cat. The package instructions say to stand it against a wall, which goes to show they know it\'s not very sturdy. The pillars seem to be plastic poles but in actuality they are just hollowed out tubes made of some thick cardboard with round plastic ends that are inserted to the tubes to link with the screws given. The tubes snap easy, my top pier did within 24 hours. The bottom platform rocks. I emailed them about replacing the top piece and I did not get a reply back. My one-year-old cat who is very excitable football tackled the whole tree to the ground and she\'s not very big.\n
 This was a gift for my mother in law and her cats. I assembled it for her and her two cats immediately fell in love with it. She has a small adult cat and a very very large adult cat and they both were able to get on top at the same time. This was placed at the center of her room but hope to put it near a wall preferably near a corner where it can hug two walls just for safety and more stability. The quality of the product is ok but that is what we get for this good price. It is made from particle wood so it does seem fragile. For now it works and hope that it can last years. It makes the cats happy and therefor my mother in law as well. Thanks :-)\n
 It\'s garbage as I initially said when I got it. 1st platform started cracking.. The wood is very flimsy &amp; cheap..what else would you expect out of China.\n
 Once I got it built the cat tree was nice. Kind of small, but works good. The assembly was AWFUL! And I mean awful! No worded directions, just pictures and it was confusing. I mean, I don\'t know how to build stuff! My husband, who works at a hardware store and puts stuff together all the time was somewhat confused by the directions as well. That really is my only complaint which is why I gave it 3 stars overall\n
 I love it and can&# ;t wait to ing my kitty home to see how much he will love it! I will admit it was a tad hard to put together but if your patient you&# ;ll get it! Also don&# ;t understand why people keep saying it&# ;s slept sturdy. If you tighten the screws down it&# ;s very sturdy! You&# ;ll just need to put it against the wall if you have a bigger cat so they can&# ;t knock it down.\n
 Perfect height, not to spendy, it&# ;s a decent price for what you are paying, there&# ;s instructions, the items are labeled on the instructions but the items themselves are not labeled. So assembly took about 20 minutes after matching pieces to the letters on the instructions. It&# ;s perfect size for a small-medium size cat and doesn&# ;t take up to much room while being a medium size cat tree.\n
 Well it\'s very nice, great price, and easy to assemble if you have a cat say under 10lbs...our big 13lber couldn\'t fit in the bottom hammock, or the house and barely fit on the top circle so I think this needs renamed as a kitten or small feline house..\n
 This product is pretty much worthless as none of my cats can fit on any part of it. These companies need to specify for kittens or small cats or if it fits large cats. Ridiculous!\n
 Fairly easy to assemble, instructions didn&# ;t seem very clear but also I don&# ;t assemble things much in the first place lol Good size for kittens and medium size cats, don&# ;t recommend for larger cats. Gets the job done and keeps kitty off the counters\n
 Easy to assemble, not by the directions though. The directions for it are ridiculous.\n
 My cat absolutely loves this scratching post! He\'s very picky about them, so I was very happy about that. It was very easy to assemble and seems to be high quality. This is very sturdy, too; my cat a large cat, so often knocks posts over because he\'s so heavy, but this one stays up. If you\'re looking for a scratching post for a large cat, definitely choose this one!\n
 My Feral Cat loves the tall scratch posts &amp; works out on them several times a day= the sisal gets fuzzed out &amp; still works. So much better than the cardboard scratchers-which my cat literally scratched up in a week &amp; then I spent countless hours picking up &amp; vacuuming up cardboard pieces. I have one scratch post in each room &amp; over the last 5yrs. haven\'t had a problem with the sofa, rugs or wood furniture being scratched on.  Before the scratch posts came in tall sizes I was buying 3 or 4 &amp; extending them.  I am happy with these &amp; will continue to purchase them.\n
 &#160;Have had this for a few weeks, and my cats still scratch on it. They destroyed a wicker hamper, so I put this in the spot where the hamper used to be. It&# ;s so much better. The wicker scraps were everywhere. This does not shed like that. Very sturdy. I would recommend it. The video clip shows that my cat likes it, but prefers his other&# ;s head.\n
 If you buy the 34" post, you\'ll need to refer back to the photo on Amazon because the directions that come with the easy-assembly post don\'t show the middle faic and ball piece. This post is rather tall, so cats will not be climbing it. If they try, they might topple the post. Our more curious cat was eager to sniff out this new post as soon as it was put in place (replacing one that the two cats have managed to shred). Sisal is a much better choice than corrugated cardboard, which can send tiny airborne particles into the noses of our feline friends. Yes, the sisal slowly shreds and sheds, but it\'s easy to remove from the base with a simple ushing. I do wish that these manufacturers would use carpet faic instead of the white, fake-fur material, which very quickly becomes dirty. Our previous post had a base of a mottled own carpet faic that never looked dirty (even though it probably was).\n
 I had previously purchased a 6&# ; cat condo for the new kitten but she wasn&# ;t too interested.  Then I purchased this and she hasn&# ;t stopped playing with it yet!</></>Super easy to put together also.  It took me about 10 minutes and it took that long because she wanted to play with it.  Best money spent!\n
 Bought this for our two very active kittens and they LOVE climbing it! I recommend the scratching post for older kitties, not the one for babies, because the babies grow up in no time, and bigger kitties  won\'t outgrow the larger post. They scramble over it constantly, and love playing with the hanging fur pouf balls that are attached.  The base is very sturdy and it is, overall) well-made.  Very easy to assemble.\n
 I foster kittens for an animal rescue in my town, so I have several scratching posts at home.  I have three fosters right now, and they all would ignore the scratching posts in favor or my upholstered furniture.  As a last ditch effort, I ordered this scratching post.  It was an instant success.  They love the new post, and, oddly enough, have even started using the other posts as well.  They love this one the best, though.  Thank you.\n
 We really needed something to take her off the sofas and this really did the trick. It was the easiest thing to put together and she enjoys it quite a bit; she almost tackled it, haha. Anyway, wonderful buy. Would 10/10 recommend.</></>Update: The other two boys took to it as well! Happy it wasn&# ;t a waste. Will add pictures of them, too.</></>Update of the Update: the little ball on the string came loose. Not as durable as previously thought, so a star will be removed. Aside from that, it&# ;s still pretty good.\n
 With 4 cats we have purchased a number of scratching posts; they have always had a recessed spot for the screw so as to not damage the floors. This scratching post does not have a recessed spot and thus is only going to cause damage to my hardwood floors. Perhaps it would be ok on carpet, but even then it may destroy the carpet over time as the screw protrudes a significant amount.\n
 I admit I can be cheap. But this baby was definitely worth every penny! Our 3 little claw babies have been tearing into this post everyday and it hasn\'t even fallen over once. The base is a good size to prevent it from toppling over. Mine is 36" tall and one of our kitties loves to s-t-r-e-t-c-h up tall and loves the little hanging fluff balls. The sisal on it is strong and glued on pretty well - it may not last for another 6 mos. but this thing is doing a great job for now and I\'d be happy to purchase another one.\n
 It was much bigger than I initially expected but no complaints there. The bottom half of the scratch post material is already coming off though after only have it for a week or so. I can see the wood.\n
 Very easy to assemble. Works great when I show my cat how to use it. Now, if she will just use it it would be nice. She likes the corner of my bed instead but it looks very nice sitting on the floor.\n
 The tube is just thick cardboard and the tube separated from the base in only 2 months use. We have 2 Persian cats that are under 8 pounds each so it was not something that received a lot of abuse. Not durable at all.\n
 Easy to assemble &amp; comes with an allen wrench so you didn\'t need tools. My cats love it, it\'s the perfect height for them to claw standing up, and not too bulky, fitting in living room fine along with the color scheme.\n
 Height is adequate but the diameter of the pole is quite narrow and it is very light weight. One of my cats attempted to use it but it moved and he immediately lost interest. I bought this for the cats to use until I can rewrap their other ones.  I will keep it but possibly change the bottom.\n
 My cat loves the post and took to it straight away.  Arrived within 24 hours and was setup in 5 minutes.  Very happy.\n
 I have 3 of these around my house for my 3 kittens. They love to run up them and balance on the top. Great scratcher with the added benefit of being a toy!\n
 They probably could have used more rope, was like this after 2 days.\n
 Looks nice when first together.  Sisal rope starts to work down.  After a month  backing is exposed about 2 inches on top of both sections.  Other ones we\'ve had didn\'t do this.  There should have been more rope rope for this not to happen.\n
 Bought a different post first, green one that looks like cactus, cats wouldn&# ;t even go near it. 10 seconds after this was assembled one cat was already using it. They don&# ;t seem to care about the balls and it&# ;s sturdy enough where our year and a half can climb it and it supports his full weight no problem. Would buy again.\n
 We have had a lot of fun joking about our cat on his stripper pole. He seriously loves this thing and being a bigger boy, it&# ;s sturdy enough for him. I may need to put something on the bottom to keep it from slipping when it&# ;s not on the carpet.\n
 The office kitten likes it very much.\n
 Easy to put together and the height is great!\n
 I only bought about a month ago and my two cats have already almost scratched the rope on the bottom off.\n
 I bought this item because it\'s 34" tall which allows my adult cat to fully stretch while scratching,  It easily assembles in about 5 minutes with the supplied allen head.  It has two attached balls which my cat plays with and another attached separately to the large base (16"X16"} so no tipping hear.  Compared with similar items it\'s also a bargain at about half their price.</></>I highly recommend!\n
 The two adult cats looked at it but didn&# ;t touch it. It&# ;s been up for over a week and no scratching has occurred. They prefer the old wider posts in the house. I didn&# ;t realize the post was smaller in diameter than the other posts we have. This would be better for kittens in my opinion.\n
 It does exactly what I needed, which is to protect the corner of the couch. They have pulled it over once or twice but I usually just keep the corner of it wedged under the couch and it holds. It\'s nice and tall, providing my boys with a nice stretch. They don\'t care much about the little attached toys but they love to scratch it.\n
 We only have this one post for out two kittens. They use it quite often. If they start scratching on furniture we simply gently carry them to the post and they continue on the post. They seem to gravitate toward this more and more as they grow. They also often play on or around it.</>While it\'s a skinny pole, they both enjoy climbing and standing on the very top.</>It was completely simple to assemble. It comes in compact packaging. The construction seems plenty sturdy for our needs.</>I cannot think of any negatives.\n
 So, I received this item and immediately after looking at the directions realized that there is a whole entire piece missing. The whole spring part, which is supposed to screw into the base, isn&# ;t even in my package. I don&# ;t really have the time to send it back because I&# ;m trying to train my cat, but in essence, I paid to only receive a part of my order. There was also cardboard already exposed on the actual post upon opening the package. Next time, I&# ;ll probably just splurge a little more to buy my sweet baby a quality toy that he really deserves.\n
 My cat loves the scratching post it&# ;s a decent size and every morning after her stretch she goes up to it and scratches on it instead of my couches so I am loving this scratch post!\n
 Nice height for kitty stretching.  Base it too small so it wobbles.  Biggest complaint is the pole itself it connected to the plastic connectors with little staples that are easily pulled out of the plastic ring holding the pole onto the base. There are also staples at the top which were concerning as kitty could get his claw caught in them when stretching to scratch.\n
 I had rescued a trash kitten and he was a big climber. Needed something verticle.</>He cannot get enough of climbing it and perching on top. My older cat loves to scratch upon it as well.\n
 Highly recommend! All my cats love this and they haven\'t scratched walls or furniture since &#129315; so far it has held up well would definitely buy again\n
 This cat scratching post was assembled in less than 10 minutes.  Seems very sturdy.  Cat is loving the extra play toys that are a part of the post and base.\n
 Scratch pole is just the right size for small kittens.  They play a little with the puff on the rope.  It\'s entertaining and good exercise for the kitties.\n
 My cat is a tall huge cat and she loves it! It&# ;s not too short like most of the other cat scratchers. Excellent quality! Very sturdy. Easy to assemble\n
 My cat loves to scratching post. Very durable and the color actually maxes are accent wall, hence the reason why I purchased it. That\'s a solid product.\n
 Luna, my rescue kitty loves her new scratching post almost as much as she likes the arm of my new living room chair!\n
 It has a small footprint so it doesn\'t take up a whole lot of space. The balls and doodads keep the cat occupied. Over all it was a great purchase.\n
 I\'m really pleased with this purchase.  It came together really easy and the cats put it to the test immediately.  We\'ve only had it for a week so time will tell, but the construction looks and feels like quality and the price was much better than Petco.\n
 assembled in about 2 minutes</>Pretty good solid base they haven\'t knocked it over yet\n
 My little girl kitty pie loves this scratching post, she started using it as soon as I assembled it!\n
 &#160;My two cat love this scratching post, the two toys don\'t turn when assembled. They went right to it once I opened the box, went crazy when put together. I put catnip at the bottom.\n
 was easy to put together and looks really nice.  Waiting to see how my cats react to it..\n
 My kitty has long legs,  this one is perfect  so she is using it  instead of chair\n
 Seems to work well for the demon child\n
 I like the height. But the ball on the base came off pretty easily. The cats still seem to like it.\n
 About the 10th scratipost in the last 6 years</>This one is the MOST DURABLE\n
 Easily assembled and my 9 month old took right to it. This scratching post is the perfect height with little distraction from anything other than that.\n
 Nothing to dislike.  I set it near the side of my couch to save it from claws - it worked. She uses the post now not my couch\n
 I ordered this a few weeks ago for my cat. She really liked it and at first was able to use it multiple times a day. I noticed it seemed to be leaning one day and when I went to adjust it the whole thing just collapsed. As you can see in the picture, the scratching post is still intact, but the connection where it screws in was too weak. Very disappointed.\n
 My 2 pound kitten tore this to shreds almost immediately which also made a mess everywhere. This is the only scratching post I&# ;ve had this issue with and he&# ;s not particularly rough on toys. It&# ;s not durable. I&# ;d recommend purchasing something else.\n
 I&# ;ve only had this for a few days but my cat seems to love it. Great way to deter her from scratching the couch. Doesn&# ;t seem to be falling apart (yet)\n
 My cat needed a scratcher and this was a great addition\n
 We\'ve only had a month and have already had to toss the balls that it comes with out. The stand is next. It\'s not durable enough for a kitten. The cotton started coming out just a few weeks later.\n
 Very easy to assemble, super sturdy and durable for the price. My cat Kiwi loves it and honestly if you&# ;re thinking about it. You should get it.\n
 Easy to put together. Great price! My little girl loves this!\n
 I got this for our new Maine Coon kitten. I am not sure it will be sturdy enough when she gets older. It has good  height but the base is a bit small.  When she tries to climb it, it wobbles.  The diameter of the pole is not big enough.\n
 I really like these and they did not cost a lot, either.\n
 Really good&#8230; I like the fact that it is tall for my larger cat as well as my smaller cat&#8230; Although the smaller cat like to climate also &#128522;\n
 Easy to assemble\n
