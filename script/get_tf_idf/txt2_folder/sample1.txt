 My cats just love this scratch post\n
 My cat loves this scratching post! She used it right away. It was simple to put together and I\'m very pleased with the price!\n
 Very tall so my cat (who is a bit large and long) loves the height of this scratching post. It was missing one of the washers (supposed to be 2) but was able to assemble it without it, if it becomes an issue I&# ;ll just run to the hardware store and grab a little washer. The blue is such a pretty color!\n
 Better than advertised, bought three of them. Sturdy and durable.\n
 It\'s has lasted longer then I thought it would\n
 My cat loves this! Easy to assemble and so far so good .\n
 It was a good value for the money but not very sturdy\n
 This is a nice big scratcher very sturdy and looks great in my house. Compared to others I have shopped for this scratcher is a great deal..cats like the toys attached\n
 The problems are: the pom-pom easily tore off the wire holding it when the cats played with it (and the stuffing went everywhere) and the whole thing falls over when they use the scratchpad or pull at the upper Pom-pom.\n
 I liked it my kitty liked it and it was quite easy to put together\n
 My cat loves this scratching post and the little toy entertains him!\n
 Super easy to assemble. My cat loves it, although she doesn\'t know to sit at the base of it to scratch, so it does topple over sometimes. As far as durability goes, it\'s relatively new, so we shall see!\n
 Kitten loves it. Climbs it daily\n
 my cat  absolutely loves this scratcher she runs at it then climbs it to the top.\n
 My cat wasn&# ;t interested in this at first, but once we moved it near where he used to scratch the couch he&# ;s loved it! Very sturdy and easy to assemble, and my kitty uses it every day. Great purchase! Cat picture for tax lol\n
 My kitten absolutely loves her new toy.\n
 Not very sturdy will not last large cats\n
 This appears to be a good product. However, my cat is a stinker and refuses to use it LOL She prefers the cardboard.\n
 It\'s fun for my kitten. Keeps her busy.\n

 Excellent toy for keeping your kittens off your furniture\n
 This scratching pole fell apart after my kitten used it twice. Not worth the money. I would spend a little more for a well made durable product. Waste of money and a disappointment!!\n
 Both cats love it. Assembly was quick and easy, too.\n
 Kitty approved\n
 The scratching post is used frequently by my 3 cats. The more they use it, they less my furniture gets scratched!\n
 My cat loves this scratching post\n
 Easy to put together, cat liked it, but rope oke within 6 months.  Only have one cat on this pole.\n
 Easy to assemble.  Assemble board could be a little bigger. Tips easy.\n
 My kitty loves it. She keeps jumping on top.\n
 This was super easy to assemble and is sturdy. My cat loves to climb and scratch this post as well as play with the hanging toys.\n
 It is a little on the small side, which is totally fine. My kitten loves it! It is a little unstable, so be careful with that.\n
 Well designed, looks nice, the cats use it all the time.\n
 My 2 cats showed no interest at all. Had horizontal sisal product before that they loved. ??\n
 &#160;It works well. Kitten loves it.\n
 Arrived with a missing part, I reached out to the seller and they sent the part and some extra toys too. My cat loves it.\n
 Easy to put together\n
 My cat really enjoys this it\'s very good quality\n
 It oke after 30 days ! No return!\n

 I bought one of these over a year ago when I adopted my cat Maxwell.  In that time he has gave that post a beating every single day and although a lot of the cord wrapping is pulled off- it has stood up to the his daily abuse in fine style. Max is a Norwegian Forest Cat. "Wegies" are climbers and they have extra strong claws that grow back extremely fast after a good trim. Max also has a six foot high cat tree as and he can use his front claws to pull himself up to the top, so I needed a good strong, ultra durable cat scratcher for him when we ought hi home.  There are several features that I love about this post.  First the base is wide and attached to the post very securely. As strong as Max is- and he is tall enough to reach about twenty inches up the post- I have never had this tip over. Heck, it has never even moved during the most furious scratching session.  Second, I like how it comes in two heights for extra large cats and average size ones. Also, it is built of really durable material that can take a beating and last for a very long time.  I HIGHLY recommend this post if you got a cat that loves to scratch. In the time I have had this post Max has never touched a piece of furniture with his nails. He  loves this thing as  much as I do!\n
 One of our cats old scratching post started rocking back and forth every time a cat tried to use it so I chose this one as a replacement.  From a human viewpoint, assembly is a no ainier using the included tool. Its the small additions that I appreciate, such as the large washer on the bottom that should stop any more rocking, plus the small rubber feet in each corner to keep it from sliding around. Its also not overly large or tall and fits perfectly in a corner.</></>The feline viewpoint is shown in the posted images. Its received the full nose check from our 6 cats and they seem to really enjoy the spring loaded puff ball, puff balls being a favorite in our house.</></>Final verdict:</>Human: 5 stars</>Cats: 5 stars</></>Thanks for reading this review and I hope its helpful\n
 Besides this 22&#8221; post and the 34&#8221; post on this page, there is also a 29&#8221; post on a separate page, which I also have.  They are identical except for height.  The taller one can tip over (due to the somewhat small base), which hasn&# ;t happened with this shorter one.  (Of course, the best would be a tall one with a larger, heavier base, since my cats love to stretch up when they scratch, but they have a cat tree for that.)  Decent but far from fancy.</></>But that&# ;s JustMe.  (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)\n
 i adopted a 9 yr old cat  and after a fwe days f us getting to know eachother i bought this for her. was not sure she would even use it. but from the start she loved stalking the ball on the spring and now using it all</> well worth the money and was so easy to put together!  spend more time watching her play with this during the week even putting a book down to watch her</> im sure any cat will love it</>my cat is almost 10 years old and a small 8 # cat\n
 This is easy to put together and made with real rope, which my cats like. It is a little bit short, so I would not get it as your main scratch post, but as an additional one, it is great. Or for kittens. Overall pleased.\n
 As you can see from the picture, this is not a huge scratching post, but it\'s a good size for kittens.  It does stay put and doesn\'t fall over, and the kittens love the dangling ball to bat around.  They compete to climb to the top, then bat each other to keep the others off the top.  Good quality, nice looking.\n
 This is easy to put together and works great. My cats use it and love it. Pretty basic product and works great and exactly as described.\n
 My husband and cat put it together. My cat above this post. Way more than his $150 cat tree.\n
 Owner reviews, price + product dimensions helped me choose this on Amazon.  I was hoping to find one suitable for both growing kittens and adult cats (over 30" height -  most listed on Amazon were under 2feet).</></>I decided to adopt my last 2 kittens due to my age.  After this batch, I\'ll likely be adopting senior cats in need.</></>My cats are outdoors/indoors, so I needed an indoor scratch post to keep them away from drapes and furniture.  My adoptees took to this post right away, how grateful and blessed am I!</></>It was very easy to assemble, and what I especially liked is that I CAN ASSEMBLE IT WITH ONE POST (LOWER HEIGHT) for the kittens; THEN, AS THEY GROW, HEIGHTEN IT BY ATTACHING THE 2ND POST.  The 2 dangles and whack-a-puffball have been an absolute draw + deeelight to watch!</></>I cannot review its durability, but can edit my evaluations later if necessary.\n
 I wanted a smaller scratch post so I could move it to different areas where behavior was happening. This fit the bill perfectly. My kitten\'s love to scratch the wrapped sisal as well as play with the attached balls. Sturdy with no tip-overs yet. Written directions for assembly were a joke but pretty easy to put together after I ignored them. Can\'t speak to durability yet but it looks as well constructed as any others I\'ve seen.\n
 My cat is in love with the giant cat tree at my parents house that has the tall scratching posts but I didn\'t have room for one like it in my house. I found this and he loves it. He\'s a pretty tall cat but he can still climb up this scratching post and act crazy! Perfect size\n
 My cats took to it immediately.  The love it.  Pros:  Good value, fairly sturdy.  Cons:  With multiple cats the rope will need to be replaced after several months.  I would recommend this product.\n
 I like it it very much and my cats like it... it looks stylish and it seems to be pretty sturdy. It has kept my cats from scratching my and new couch! I sprinkle cat nip on it about once a week to keep the cats interested in it.\n
 Excellent kitty loves it . Amazing how cats know what to scratch and what not to.</>I can\'t say how tipsy it may get when cat gets bigger put almost anything would tip over if a cat jumps at it and hangs from it.\n
 Big enough for our cat and she loves it. She scratches and stretches several times a day.\n
 &#160;I wound up getting two of these and they are both used and loved.\n
 Great price,easy assembly,fast delivery.thank you\n
 oh my gosh , i laugh at my cat daily with this post. he loves it and is on it many times a day . best thing i ever bought  him. definitely recommend .i bought because he started scratching on my and new love seat. this has totally kept him away. going to buy a back up .\n
 Such a great deal for the money! (So far, it&# ;s only and new and I hope it holds up to two cats daily usage!) Its nice n tall, too. Recommended.\n
 Good buy\n
 My cats love this scratching post. Easy to build\n
 Very easy to assemble, good and sturdy and won\'t topple over if your cat is crazy like mine and likes to jump to the tippy top. :)\n
 Would of gave 5 stars if it was a bit taller but for the price and quality I recommend.\n
 My cat uses it all the time. Inexpensive, durable and it works.\n
 Product exceeded expectations.\n
 It seems well made. One that we got a couple of days before this one has started to fall apart. This one hasn\'t\n
 This scratcher post is very easy to assemble. I like how high it is. But the quality itself if not good. It is wobbly and the base is not very sturdy also. My cat won\'t even play with it.\n
 This item arrived and by the size of the box, I thought I received the wrong item.  However, once assembled, it looks great and is tall enough for my cats to stretch out while scratching the post.  The sisal material looks very durable and the post was easy to assemble.\n
 My cats love scratching my walls, put this in front of them, and now they only scratch it and me.\n
 I used these products for my 2 dogs.\n
 Looks good and my cat liked it, but it only lasted for two months.\n
 My cat loves this sturdy post...sturdy if you put a 10 lb weight on the bottem like i did that is.\n
 I bought this post for my cats because it is taller than the rest and it was great until about a month in the string around it already came undone. It&# ;s holding together right now by a knot. Not the best quality\n
 My 6 weeks old kitty loves it! The way she entertains herself with it&#8230; it&# ;s just amazing. Highly recommend it!\n
 My cat loves this and uses it often\n
 I assembled this fairly easily, but cannot figure out where the little fuzz ball with the spring goes.  Are there instructions?\n
 It was fairly easy to put together - I took the advice of another reviewer and built it upside down &amp; top to bottom.  A second pair of hands would have been useful for the screwing everything to the bottom but I managed alright.  The construction seems really solid and durable and my *large* cat has thrown his weight at it top &amp; bottom and it didn\'t tip over, which is always a concern with cats.</></>The blue accents are gorgeous - I love that color.  The rope is very prickly - the cats don\'t seem to mind it, but it was unpleasant for me to hold and felt like it kept giving me splinters as I assembled it... but I\'m fine - no actual splinters.</></>The balls got my cats\' attention right away; but they seem so interested in playing with them that they aren\'t using the pole to scratch!  My cats are finicky though - they won\'t use cardboard scratchers either.</></>So it\'s well made &amp; pretty &amp; interesting to cats... but you never know how a cat is going to use a thing so your miles may vary.\n
 We had a small scratching post but needed a larger one as the kittens started growing.  This scratching post has been perfect! Each of them like to climb it and play at the top and it has never toppled over.  I am very happy with my purchase!\n
 Super easy to put together. Maybe took 5 to 10 minutes if that. Cat loves it. Without this she resorts to the furniture.\n
 Great quality for the price.  Easy to assemble.  The cat scratch rope is held on tightly with what I assume glue.\n
 My cat doesn\'t seem to care for it unless it\'s coated with catnip lol but it\'s solid and sturdy and easy to put together. And good price\n
 My cat is not easily pleased by things, but he loves the scratch post. He hangs out by it all day and uses it all the time this is a great purchase\n
 Thank you\n
 Sent it back to damaged for it to be used\n
 Easy to assemble and fairly sturdy.  I appreciate that I am able to order this item to suit my two tall cats and it allows them to stretch as is a cat\'s habit\n
 No issues with the assembly.</>I bought this based on the multiple positive reviews but my cat\'s paws get stuck on it. He used it possibly 3 times and as to be expected, he has not touched it in over a month,  even with the sprinkling of catnip.\n
 Easy to assemble and my kitty uses it frequently.\n
 This was a very good size for the price. I have a smaller one and my big kitties keep knocking it down. I need to distract them from the sofa so i got this. Other scratchers at the same price are shorter so this is a steal. It&# ;s tall and stable, comes with the dangling ball thing that will entertain them more. I spray some catnip and they immediately get to work lol they scratch it every day. It&# ;s tall enough for them to stretch too. Im glad i found this after looking around. My sofa can live in peace now lol\n
 Not worth the money!! Looks like it may be sturdy but with 2 important pieces missing, it is impossible to assemble. Very disappointed!!\n
 I got this in August, it is now March. The ball toy on top got ripped off VERY early on, but I got it more for the post itself. Unfortunately they\'ve loosened the rope on the top half and the bottom half is missing for two inches from the middle.</>I have 4 cats.\n
 This is the crowning piece to my cat wall. It is a bit tricky to install though, especially if you put it up as high as I did. You need to use a provided template to drill 4 holes for the attaching screws will screw into (easy part). The hard part is, after assembling the house, you need to attach it to the wall, lining up holes on the back of the house to the 4 holes you drilled earlier. The house is not light and you\'ll probably need the help of an extra set of hands. It\'s not clear from the instructions, but this is NOT TO BE INSTALLED IN DRYWALL. That said, I didn\'t catch that and only found out after installing and reading more reviews on Amazon. I installed into one stud (coincidence), so it feels pretty solid. Sidenote, this was the last piece I added and I "eyeballed" the leveling after being so careful to level all the other pieces. You can\'t tell from this picture, by my eyeballs were wrong! This house is a little crooked. I have a Catsuit Mario plushie I\'m thinking of attaching as if he\'s dangling off the edge, making the house tilt with his weight. Then I\'ll tell people it\'s crooked on purpose :P\n
 I&# ;ve purchased a few FUKUMARU products, and so far they have all been amazing. This cat house is super sturdy and heavy duty&#8230; I have no worries that it will fall apart or get torn up over time. Unlike other FUKUMARU products&#8230; this was a little more difficult to assemble and might have been a little easier with a second set of hands. Spend the extra money on good products like this, it won&# ;t disappoint.\n
 The wood looks nice and well made but face panel (B) arrived oken. I do not think it was worth the money for receiving a oken product. The company has reached out and wants to make it right. Good customer service goes along ways. I glued the oken peices back together and my cat loves it. My mom just got 2 kittens and I have the best gift idea! Thank you for your experience FUKUMARU\n
 Maybe if the instructions were included, I\'d see where I went wrong trying to put it together but after 2 attempts of getting it on the wall and piece by piece, if falls apart, that was all I needed. The 2 stars is I like the IDEA of the house, just need a better, overall structure.\n
 Only buy if you&# ;re willing to do an hour of research on how to mount it correctly to your type of wall. They shouldn&# ;t even sell this as a wall mount because of how heavy it is. They advertise &#8216;only mount on ick or cinder block&# ;. OK.</></>Still haven&# ;t found a good way to mount it\n
 It&# ;s a nice piece added to my cat wall. The only 2 complaints is that it&# ;s super heavy and one of the piece didn&# ;t have holes to connect to the other piece. I had to industrial glue it together. It worked and it&# ;s cute!\n
 Adopted an extremely sick which is now healthy! Didn&# ;t know how we would mix or if he&# ;d feel comfortable with me. Giving him space other than just hiding behind stuff on the ground was important. I did have to have someone come over here to install all of that. My cat is in love!\n
 The box wouldn\'t hold together correctly. Any amount of pressure made the front and floor part fall off.\n
 We plan to use these in our cat rescue adoption center. It is very important for cats to be able to escape to safety, or retreat when they need space. These are awesome and perfect for our needs!\n
 This is a great cat house! It&# ;s sturdy and well made, and looks clean and modern on the wall. I like that it doesn&# ;t have paw prints or other &#8220;cat&#8221; icons on it, like some other cat furniture. We also got the Fukumaru hammock and stairs, and they have all been great.</></>A WARNING:</>- It&# ;s heavy! Absolutely do not attach it to drywall alone (or use the included anchors) we actually drilled 2 extra holes in line with a stud, so that we could have three sturdy screws directly in the stud. Then, we got the most heavy duty Molly toggle bolts they had at Home Depot for the holes that hit drywall. You don&# ;t want this tearing out if the wall and falling to the floor with your kitty inside!</></>Our cats stated exploring right away, and they love their cat wall!\n
 My cat wouldn&# ;t use this until I added a sisal pad into the bottom. When cats jump and land, they need a good grip.\n
 &#160;This cat tower provides Our kitty with a lot of room to rest and play.  I really love the sage green color. It just looks more tree lake and is more fun than the traditional beige. The base is why enough to support the height of this tower.  All of the scratchpad areas are covered well. The material underneath is not exposed making it more difficult to shred.</></>It can easily be assembled by one person. However I will add that the base piece has three holes. These holes aren&# ;t labeled, so make sure you put the right piece into each hole based on the look of the final product. I did not do that and had to disassemble and reassemble to correct my mistake. That being said, I was easily able to fix my problem. Everything else goes together very easily per the instructions.</></>My cat loves sitting in the very top bed. She loves perching a pie. This bed is wide enough for our adult cat. We have had a few cat towers that are better designed for kittens or smaller cats, this does provide adequate space for her. She has a lot of fun with the fluffy ball toys. She enjoys batting them around. But her favorite activity for this cat tower is enjoying a nice cat nap.</></>The top perch that she enjoys taking her naps in is easily washable. It has a removable cover that can just be taken off and put in the washing machine. All the other surfaces are easily cleaned with the vacuum.\n
 - 1st, it is smaller, I have a smaller space and another cat tree already so, it works well for me to not have multiple enormous cat trees in a small space. I measured before ordering and it fits into a smaller odd corner, with the hammock wrapping around the edge.  I moved it away a bit from the wall since the photos, so he had more access to both sides to lunge and grab hold of</>- It is really cute with some interesting things and my cat is at that tween kitten age that he needs to be entertained (hence the two cat trees)</>- At first, I was excited that the different platforms were labelled, but it would have been way more helpful to me to have the posts labelled and the screws separated and labelled  watched and paused the video to figure out.  It was frustrating at first, I had to take apart and reassemble a couple times.</>- My initial assembly issue was  I was using the two smaller green posts at the bottom, and actually it should be the two mid-size green posts at than the one of the smaller fuzzy posts on top (has the holes to put the sticks in on side that are not visible) the other smaller fuzzy post goes on top of the luau cave; the two sisal posts are stacked with the hammock; the pet bed on top of the cave and the smaller fuzzy post is cool, it just wraps around one of the square posts.  I opted to use the ramp going to the cave elsewhere, it gives him more space on the bottom, and he doesn\'t need it to hop in</>- it feels sturdy</>- it\'s cute and a nice mossy green Hawaii them that I like</>- the cove I was worried that he wouldn\'t like, and I do like it -- he loves it too.  It seems too small for him to me, but he wouldn\'t get out of it when I was trying to screw that part together to give you an idea.</></>Summary:</>*Cute</>*Kitten Size (maybe I will combine with the larger and make a monster cat climbing gym, but having the two in different areas is working to run from one to other and peak attention it seems)</>*the cave has softer walls, which my kitten seems to like</>*cat seems to like the play toys and although seems a bit small to him, so far day one he is def attracted to it.</>*I did pay less for my larger cat tree, however this is complimentary, and I like the Hawaii Lua / Moss Green tree theme to this one\n
 &#160;I love this Cat Tree! Firstly, it is very easy to assemble. It is my first cat tree, and it is my first time assembling a cat tree. I was worried I cannot combine it successfully, but the truth is I worried too much since it has very detailed installation instructions. Secondly, my kittens Miu and Pi love it. The cat tower design is unique, and it has good stability. Nice Cat Tree!\n
 &#160;As you can see Merlin liked the tassels he checked out the rest of tree but couldn&# ;t fit in hanging basket or house .</>It&# ;s a great tree well made and so pretty if only he could fit in everything I would keep it.</>I would definitely recommend this for anyone that has a smaller size cat.\n
 &#160;I love love love this, my mommy got me and my sister this for our birthday, we love it plz buy it for your cats&#8230; and thank you to the manufacture for the great quality and price and colors.</>Review written by kitties &#128008;&#8205;&#11035; &#128008;&#8205;&#11035;\n
 The reason why I came back to write the review is to tell you about how unstable this cat tree is. My cat was sleeping in it last night on the top platform, he must have rolled, and totally took a dive. Kaboom! He didn\'t know what hit him. After being assembled this tree rocks back and forth. I added weight to the base and pushed it against a wall to avoid this happening again.</>If I were to reorder I\'d definitely READ THE DIMENSIONS because it\'s also quite a lot smaller than I imagined. My chonky cat fills the crow\'s nest to the im. I still give three stars because my cat does enjoy it and it was really cheap.\n
 &#160;nice product this is the first day that she use the cat tree\n
 I love this cat tree for the variety of places for my cat to sit! However the assembly was a little tricky to follow and many of the screw holes were not cut through the faic. I also noticed that the pictures do not fit the actual scale and the hole for my cat to go through is far too small for a very tiny cat. The carpet sheds everywhere and the base isn&# ;t as sturdy as I&# ;d like for my wobbly cat.</>Overall I&# ;m fairly happy with this purchase, but I would not recommend paying full price for this for a cat over 10 pounds.\n

 The product and bags for it were already opened in the box I received. It was missing multiple parts. The instructions are also very unhelpful. Assembly is difficult and nonsensical even if we would have had all of the parts.\n
 I love everything with this product  It was smaller than I had thought and since my cats are very large they can only use one perch  but the measurements were clearly stated , so it was my mistake to assume it woud be larger\n
 Such a cute and fun cat tree! My cats love it but it&# ;s a bit smaller than I thought. My 2 cats (both weighing around 11-12 pounds) are a bit too big for the bowl and perch but they&# ;re making it work. I think it would be perfect it for a smaller cat or for kittens . Overall great cat tree and highly recommend it.\n
 Took me less than 1 hour to assemble. Beautiful and soft, my kittens love it! Might not be large enough for cats over 15lbs though.\n
 I really like it except the little house is too small for cats at 10lbs+ #thestruggleisreal\n
 WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR CATS 1ST OF ALL.. IT\'S VERY SOFT IT ASSEMBLES REALLY EASY SO EASY AND THE COST ISN\'T BAD EITHER. THE THING OF IT IS THESE TYPES ARE MADE FOR LIGHT WEIGHT CATS AND THEY\'RE MADE FOR SINGULAR OR VERY FEW CATS LIKE 2 CATS IN LIGHT WEIGHT VARIETY I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE WAY IT\'S MADE. THE POLE THAT THE PADS SIT UPON WELL THE POLES SIT ON A PLASTIC CASTER AND IT BARELY GOES UP INSIDE THE POLE AND THIS IS NEEDED FOR SUPPORT . THE POLE MOVES WHEN THE CATS GET ONTO THE PAD WHICH SIT UPON THE POLES WHICH SIT UPON PLASTIC CASTERS WHICH ARE SITUATED LOW ON THE PLATFORM. THE CASTERS NEED TO GO UP INSIDE THE POLE FOR A PRETTY GOOD WAYS TO GET PROPER STABLE SUPPORT OUTTA IT FOR NOW THE POLE BARELY GETS FITTED ONTO THE CASTERS WHICH IN TURN OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU\'LL SEE THE POLE START TO SWAY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND EVENTUALLY IT TOPPLES OVER AND YOU\'LL SEE WHAT I\'M SAYIN.. I\'M NOT PUTTING DOWN THIS COMPANY OR THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE I\'M NOT THEY\'RE GOOD PEOPLE THERE\'S JUST A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW..

 At first I was a bit concerned that it did not come with assembly instructions but I was able to figure it out fairly easy. But for someone who hasn\'t assembled products before it would be a little confusing. My only suggestion would be to include instructions.</>Once assembled, our new kitten loved it and is having a ball!\n
 Bought for new kitty so she has a place to escape from the dogs. Great hideaway, lounge up top, and she uses the scratch post as well. Affordable and just what we needed\n
 My large furry friend loves her new cat tower tree thing. Its nice and tall but not too tall. For what it is its pretty sturdy, my kitty is a pretty big girl. She likes to sleep in the top padded section and bird watch out the window. My only gripe is i wish the rope on the legs covered the entirety of the legs as she has ripped the carpet above where the rope stops in less than a week, but its not a big deal to me....she has mostly stopped clawing my furniture...\n
 Ordered this as a Christmas present for our 2 new kittens...  But they have been destroying our furniture, so we decided to open it early. And i am so glad we did! They absolutely love it! Plus, it is really sturdy &amp; hasnt oke even w my 2 year old climbing on it! Highly recommend!\n
 Took about 15 minutes to assemble. I\'m happy with how it turned out. My cat loves it and his favorite spot so far is the basket.\n
 easy to assemble, and my cats love it, they fight over the basket and the top. i will be buying another one soon.\n
 Seems sturdy! You can screw to the wall for extra support. It is very soft! Also it is easy to put together with the instructions they sent. Fast shipping. Winter loves it! It is also big enough for her to get in and have plenty room to play.\n
 I&# ;ve had this in a house with up to two cats and they both loved it and got good use of it. If one was in the top area the other (who I thought wouldn&# ;t fit) went in the small bowl hammock thing. They use is all the time and it&# ;s not too big.\n
 Grandson say his cats lov the tree.\n

 I am very happy with this purchase.  It arrived when they said it would. Was pretty easy to assemble.  Good quality, good stability, and is eye appealing.</>It\'s nice and soft...highly recommend this company.\n
 my kitten is just learning to play with the kitty condo and shes lovin\' it. glad i purchased it.\n
 Good size, sturdiness and price, would purchase again\n
 My big fuzzy cat highly approved. Great size and value for the money.\n
 Perfect size!\n
 But he has not .\n
 Puurrrrfect!\n
 It is the perfect hight and it is my cats new hangout\n
 &#160;My bunny is adapting to it very well. He was scared at first when coming down because it is a little steep for him to go one spot to another. But he seems to love it! My hopes is that he will chill out more and this will help his wild adventures.\n
 She loves her new cat tower. With her climbing all over the parts as I assembled it, I was still able to get it put together in less than 20 minutes. It does come with a mounting acket to attach it to the wall but I think it\'s sturdy enough to stand freely.\n
 Our cat loves it\n
 My cats love it!! There&# ;s a million pieces to it but it only took about 20 minutes to set up, it&# ;s surprisingly sturdy, one of my cats weighs 12 pounds and it hardly moves when he jumps on it!\n
 Even has strap to fasten to wall so it does not tip\n
 &#160;but I figured it out and my cat loves it!\n
 It&# ;s big enough for my 17lbs cat and can even hold my 35lb toddler. So if you are looking for a sturdy tower for a BIG cat this one is the best I&# ;ve found!\n
 The tower boards were not long enough in length and the lowered one was short about t2 inches.  The top board was short and when made to go together the support posts swayed inward.\n
 I adopted a feral cat that was so scared and shy.  Also he began to claw my chairs.  We bought this to change his bad behavior.  He understands immediately that he can claw this.  He loved the cave part at the beginning then later the bed on top.  Now that he is growing older (5months) he hardly uses it.  Maybe in the winter he will.\n
 &#160;I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to put this together.</>Packaging: This came in a box (as depicted) that was within another box, therefore the stuff inside the inner box was OK even if the exterior box was dented or squeezed.</>Pieces were of good quality, with everything being soft and well-assembled. There are no rips/tears or areas of concern. The nuts, bolts, and allen wrench were all made of genuine steel, not cheap plastic.</>Assembly: It was not difficult to put this together. (about 45 minutes) It works excellent if you follow the assembly instructions to the letter. I only had two problems: 1. Because the pieces aren\'t labeled, you had to "find" the correct piece and hardware to use on it&#8212;but there aren\'t many to get mixed up with, so it worked out fine. (There was one bolt that was shorter than the others, but it was in its own bag!). 2. The screws did not always "catch" as quickly as I had hoped. Screwing the covered box hole down to the base, for example, needed a little force to get it correctly. It was also difficult to line up holes to screw "blindly." But none of this was due to a manufacturing defect; it was simply a case of "lining it up." Simply take your time, note where the holes line up, and then get to work.</>Sturdiness: In the end, this was a strong build. If I needed to, I could easily and confidently move it around the house. Nothing was strewn about or cause for concern. Because the pouch basket swivels (depending on how tightly the poles are locked around it), you can put it around the pole wherever you like! (Because my kitten is too little to jump from it to the nearest platform, she liked being able to walk down in the center.)</></>Overall, I\'m pleased with the quality and ease of construction. Everything is incredibly soft, and I expect my kitten to spend a lot of time playing with it.\n
 &#160;My cats LOVE this tree. I bought it to replace their old bedroom one and they immediately took to it. It&# ;s super easy to put together and the perfect size. My cats are full grown (2 1/2 years old) and the orange boi isn&# ;t smol. He&# ;s a chonker and as you can see, it&# ;s not bad for his size! It seems very sturdy even without the anchor.\n
 The directions were not very clear, but after studying the pieces for a few minutes we figured out how to assemble the cat tree and our oversize (read fat!) cat had no trouble understanding how to use it! It\'s nice and sturdy and doesn\'t wobble or tilt, something I was afraid of since the cat really is quite large and heavy.\n
 They state that this product is tip resistive; IT IS NOT.  The base is light weight and flimsy.  The product is not sturdy.  I placed two icks on the base and secured it to the wall and is it still tippy.  My cat will not use it because  it is not stable.  The instructions for assembly were not specific and two parts were incorrectly labeled.  This product is made of substandard materials, is not easily assembled and is basically useless.  I wish I had never wasted my money on this product.\n
 My cat lovessss this treeee it&# ;s his first one! he&# ;s about 10 pounds so a medium cat it&# ;s pretty shaky but we put the tree next to the window so he could see so we could just put the strap in the window and it keeps it stable for him &#128513;\n
 I&# ;ve had this for 2 months and the top bed is a bit wobbly and my cat has started falling off (he&# ;s 12lbs).  It was easy to assemble but at this point I&# ;m going to need to replace it with something sturdier.\n
 Chunky cats beware! Works for my big cats but the hammock is too small. So they store toys inside it.\n
 Absolutely love this.\n
 The cat tower was easy to assemble with the attached directions and tools. Also, the faic lining on the tower is very soft!\n
 My cat loves it very sturdy and the height is perrrrrrrr fect &#9786;&#65039;\n
 My cat loves this cat tree. Well worth the Money. Easy to put together.\n
 I have two cats who love to lay on this tower and watch our neighbors walk by outside the window. They love the scratching posts as well. Assembly was ok but got a little confusing when you had to assemble two posts close to each other. My cats are very chunky so sometimes the tower wobbles a bit when they get on it, but it never tipped over, so I\'m actually impressed. If you need the extra protection though, it comes with one of those straps so you can screw it into the wall. I love the grey color. One thing I\'m sad about is my cats seem to not care about the hammock at all. It just kind of sits there, always empty, as they compete for the top bed. The little house on the bottom is a hit. Both cats love sleeping in it, and chasing each other through the holes. Overall, this is an amazing cat tower and my cats definitely approve.\n
 This cat tower is quite a bit larger than your average small cat tower. It can just support all four of my cats on it at the same time. The flat scratcher tier is a nice touch for my older cat who prefers to not scratch above his head and my younger ones love fighting over the ball from the upper and lower beds. I don\'t expect the ball to last long, but they never do in my household!</></>Putting this tower was about as frustrating as putting together any other cat tower. The instructions were average- not super detailed, but not difficult to figure out. It is a pain to line up the screws with the support poles inside the cat house and the stickers had fallen off some of the support poles. It is easy to figure out which ones they are though.</></>The antitip device is a strap that is screwed into the wall with a screw and sheetrock anchor. It seems to do the job for now, but my cats like to play with it. It will probably go either way whether or not it lasts because of this. I do wish that it was a removeable feature as the tower seems sturdy on its own, but it\'s not a serious enough drawback for me to factor it into my rating.</></>Overall, this is a great cat tower that my cats love so far! It\'s a good height and full of features to keep them interested.\n
 &#160;My cats absolutely love this cat tower, so we\'ll start there.  If they are not in my lap, they are sleeping on this tower. It is very cozy and comfortable, but that is where it ends.</></>It is very unstable and cannot support larger cats without leaning to the right. There simply is not enough support. It needs one more pole in the front plus a larger base.</></>If you have kittens, this would be perfect but not so much for larger cats. My youngest male is 20 pounds and it wobbles when he jumps to the top. When both my male and female are on the beds, it leans to the right.  Even if I did use the wall mount to prevent the tower from falling over, it would still lean to the right.</></>I would give this tower 3 stars, but my cats love it so much that I will give it 4 stars but only because they love it.\n
 This fits perfectly in the corner of my house. It\'s not too big or too small. My larger cat maybe too large for it but it\'s perfect for a medium size cat or kitten. The little hammock is perfect for my kitten to sleep in. Both of my cats enjoy the 3 scratching stations. This took my husband and 9 year old son about a 1/2 an hour to put together. They said it was fairly simple to follow directions. I really like the fact that the top part comes off and you can put it in the washer and wash it. My 5 month old kitten really enjoys the ball with the jingle bell. It\'s made out of very nice faic and it\'s soft. It does come with an attachment to be able to put on the wall to make this more sturdy so it will not tip over. I decided not to do it.  I think it\'s sturdy enough for the cats to jump in-and-out of without it tipping over.\n
 The cat tree arrived in a compact box, and I was pleasantly surprised at the soft, fur-like faic covering the majority of the pieces.  I took everything out, it&# ;s all there!  Assembly is pretty straight forward, I suggest installing the four pillars that go in the bottom cube from the top first, followed by the four screws from the bottom.  Everything else went together easily, with my cat getting more &amp; more interested as time went by.  I had it all put together in about 20 minutes, and it seems stable &amp; should be able to withstand whatever she decides to do with it.  Who knows though, she&# ;s a fickle cat&#8230;my hope is that she&# ;ll be more interested in this than bothering my husband during his important work meetings&#8230;I doubt it though. &#128572;. Overall, it&# ;s a nice cat tree &amp; worth the price!\n
 I love everything about this cat tower. It\'s the perfect height. It\'s really soft. It\'s really easy to assemble. It has the best platforms. I have a 5 yr old and he loves his special perch. It has a little side perch with a sisal platform above. He loves jumping from the perch to the sisal where he lays and watches everything because it\'s the perfect height. The top platform is comfortable and large enough for him. I use the side basket to keep all his fluffy, crinkle and belled balls which I put out at night for him to play. If he wants to play anytime, he can reach in and paw one out. It was really easy to assemble. The instructions are very clear and the parts were labeled. For the money, this is the best cat tower I have ever had.\n
 I took my time, so it took just under an hour to get the whole thing together. You can see from the first picture, my cat was a barrel of laughs climbing in and out while I was building it.</>All the pieces lined up correctly and none of the screws or washers were missing.</>This is the first large cat tree I\'ve gotten for the little feller. He likes the hanging bell the most. He won\'t go in the hammock, even with catnip. When I move it into its permanent spot, then I will bolt it to the wall for more support.  It seams pretty sturdy, but Jack is a big boy. The price on Amazon is $60, which I think is fair. The boards are also sturdy and the fur is extremely soft.\n
 This is the mother of all cat condos.</>It&# ;s really amazing and has a lot of fun stuff for your cat.</></>It is a bit overwhelming at first to see all the parts to put together. It&# ;s fairly easy though and my husband had it done in under 30 mins.</></>Features:</>Three levels</>Cat bowl/hammock</>Scratching posts</>Scratch pad as one level.</>Top level Is a cat bed area</>Built in toy</></>Super soft</>Sturdy with an option to attach to the wall so your cat won&# ;t tip it while jumping off/onto it.</>My cat couldn&# ;t wait to move in.</>Nice thank you note included.</>Def recommend this one.</>&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;\n
 My big boy likes it. My cat is 17 pounds of pure furry beauty. He adores this thing, and spends all of his time in the top tier. I worry about the hammock piece under the weight of his voluptuousness.  He uses the other tiers as a route to get to the top and spends little to no time on them. I suspect that is because the platforms themselves are small while the top is large.  This would make a great cat tree for kittens, but my big bubba loves it still.</></>This was easy to put together. No instructions, but looking at the picture was more than enough. Took me about 30 minutes, but I also had my six year old slowing me down, I mean helping me.\n
 My initial opinion is that this cat tree would be too small/unstable for my chonky kitty. However, this cat tree comes with a wall anchor strap and screw which works extremely well. This extra security allows my kitty to play and rest without worries of her chunkiness causing a tipover. She weighs approximately 10 lbs.</></>It was easy to build and is a good size as well. The faic is very soft and doesn\'t shed.</></>My kitties love it and I am very happy with the purchase.\n
 &#160;I love this cat condo and so does my cat. The color grey is pretty. The material is plush. The footprint is small but the size is big. There&# ;s lots for the kitty to keep busy or just take a nap. The top cover is washable. It was well packaged and easy to setup. There&# ;s such a difference from the ones in the store and this high quality cat tree. It really is five stars!\n
 Assembly was very easy, about 15 minutes. Very sturdy, and our 9 pound kitty fits nicely. She loves the top bed for naps and takes her toys into the bottom house to hdebthem from our dog. Thebscratch pads and posts seem good quality and she took to the entire set up very quickly.\n
 A little smaller than expected, all my big boys hang out and off of it, but they like it anyway because they\'re cats. They scratch on it all the time which is what i really wanted it for anyway so it works.\n
 Bought of course for my cat. It was easy to assemble and directions were perfect. My cat absolutely approved and loves it. It&# ;s definitely made to last and very durable. Worth every penny!\n
 This cat tree was pretty easy to assemble and is a nice medium size. My cat loves it and wouldn\'t leave me alone while assembling it for him.\n
 This purchase was all around awesome!!! I probably researched every cat house on Amazon and a couple other sites. Based on reviews and the slightly larger size of the two beds on top, I chose this Yaheetec Cat Tree Condo. Let me say, I just have one very spoiled 7 yr old Bengal. He is very smart, very vocal and very curious. It did not take him long to move right into this Cat condo! It&# ;s very soft and offers so many places to cat nap he will never get bored! He has tried them all too! He loves the scratch pad on the bottom level and naps down there too! Very easy to put together.\n
 This product was easy to assemble taking 30 minites to unbox and assemble. It\'s sturdy built and even has a way to attach to a wall. Roomate\'sa fat cat can sleep in basket with out bending it. Great addition tocatifacation\n
 The cat tower is super easy to assemble. The height is perfect. Our 2 kittens can climb freely, sleep in a hammock and a top nest respectively, and like to use scratching posts and a scratching board. Very recommended!\n
 &#160;This cat tree is for a small cat or 1 medium cat, not recommended for a big cat or more than 1 cat. My cat only sleeps on the top, the hammock is too small to sleep in even though my cat is small as you can see in the video. The instruction is clear, easy to assemble. Overall is a good product.\n
 Easy to assemble, perfect size , good quality\n
 My cats love this tree so much! Both cats laid in it for hours after it was built and while building as well! this is sturdy and it does take a little while to build but so worth it! 10/10 recommend this!\n
 Just fantastic!! My cats love it.\n
 Nice feel to the faic and pretty easy to assemble. Would recommend as a gift for a fellow feline lover. Feels very sturdy after fully assembled.\n
 cat loves it\n
 I purchased this cat tree for a mom cat and her 6 kittens. Mom can use the tree (for now) to get away from her ood by going up to the higher anches - she is a little too big for the cubby hole. The kittens (5 weeks old) love to get inside the cubby or on top of the cubby. It\'s not too high that if they (ungracefully) topple off that they will get hurt. It doesn\'t seem to deter them from getting back up on the top of the cubby.</>The faic so far is holding up with all the little ones scratching. I noticed a bit of fuzz in their kennel but I think that\'s due to the newness of the faic - I probably could have taken the vaccuum to it first.) I was worried their little claws would get stuck in the scratching post and they would need help getting removed - so far all is well.</>I do recommend using the included screw to attach to the wall - it is stable if you don\'t -- with little kitties near the bottom. As they get bigger and explore the top areas I think it will need that stability of being attached to the wall.\n
 Smaller than the picture, a bit flimsy but works great for a cat that wants to lay in the window.\n
 I rarely ever leave a review but this cat tree definitely blew away my expectations.  I have 2 kitties both 3 years old the tabby is 12 lbs and the orange and white is 16lbs.</></>I bought this to replace a tattered old tree whose scratching post had destroyed.  I was specifically looking for something sleek/modern looking with a "high" bed and a scratching post. Based on the reviews I figured my orange cat would be unable to use the tree given his size but figured he\'d enjoy the scratching post and I could use the bottom box to store their toys. Well much to my surprise both of my kitties are all over this tree. I\'ve only had it assembled for 24 hours and have already captured so many cute photos of both of them using it. I did spray it with their cat nip spray so they knew this was theirs. I\'m very happy with my purchase.</></>I definitely think I\'ll be buying a second one. I\'m very impressed with this cat tree.\n
 The tree is smaller than it looks, but it\'s my fault for not paying attention to the mention of it being a 30" tree.  It also weighs very little, which means that my 7 lb. siamese cat can easily pull it over when she\'s trying to use the sisal post.  The soft areas attach to the smooth surfaces with quarter-sized velcro stickers, and while they do hold decently well, I don\'t see them holding long term.  I wouldn\'t recommend this tree for anything but a kitten. Even then, it\'s too expensive for what you get.</></>Update - The tree is now selling for less than 70% of what I paid, so I\'d consider it a good deal for a kitten. Other than that, look for something bigger.\n
 My cat loves sitting on the perch and looking out the window. She even uses the scratching post. I&# ;ve never had a cat actually use a post that l\'ve bought, so it&# ;s very nice. So glad that she likes it. It was very easy to put together, is space saving, and isn&# ;t ugly like many cat trees are. It flows nicely with a room. Love that it has washable pads so it won&# ;t become stinky or flea infested. Very pleased, l would definitely recommend it. Not for large cats though. Best for petite cats and kittens. :)\n
 This is just about perfect for our needs. My cat is a large bodied cat and is a little chunky (fluctuates between 14 and 16 lbs). This tower fits him well. He curls up well both inside the box and up top on the bed. He\'s a curling up sort of cat, not a sprawling out cat. If he were a sprawling cat, this might be a bit small for him (though he does like draping himself over the edge of the top portion). The height is perfect for seeing out of our windows too (not obnoxiously tall, just medium height and simple). As far as quality goes, I\'m happy with this cat condo too. I wanted something that wasn\'t covered in bad carpet and that looked nice in the house. The laminated wood looks pretty nice on this, and it\'s sturdy and was easy to put together. I also like that all of the pads/beds are velcro, so you can take them off to wash them.\n
 My grown cats turned it over the first time they hopped up on it. It may work well for kittens. It&# ;s very unstable. The pads do not stay stuck with Velcro pads provided. We could not figure a way to make the top most pad stay fastened at all. We bought this for a specific spot. I am going to try using some old tree parts and adding a plywood top above the box. Then We will see elastic straps to some old cat beds we have already. If it works I will review again with pictures. I am going to recycle some bolts from old cat trees as well. If we end up using this, it will barely resemble what it started out as. If you are buying this tree for full grown cats, don&# ;t. It might be good for kittens. But leave the top shelf completely off. It is dangerous. I will put a couple of 5 pound dumbbells in the base  to stabilize.</></>I modified it using old cat tree parts. I stabilized the base so it doesn&# ;t fall over when a cat jumps off. I added a larger platform to the middle as well as an old cat bed that has elastic in the 4 corners so it doesn&# ;t slide off. I used a top platform from an old cat tree that has side for the top platform. The cat tree is stable and each perch will hold a full sized cat now. My oldest cat expresses her opinion of both the tree as well a my modifications there in the picture. I am keeping it remind myself to consider any cat purchase at least 16 times before I buy.\n
 My cat doesn&# ;t enjoy anything &#8220;made&#8221; for cats. She ignores beds and toys and opts for pillows and hair ties. However, she immediately fell in love with this tree! I introduced it to her and she quickly took a liking to the top tier especially. Super easy to assemble, some of the pieces made me nervous because they seemed lightweight but it doesn&# ;t wobble when she jumps up there so I trust it. The only thing I&# ;ll say is that the circumference of the top tier could be too small for larger cats. My cat is on the small size and she fills out pretty much the whole bed.</></>But all in all it was worth the money! My cat couldn&# ;t be happier, this is the best purchase I&# ;ve made for her!\n
 I hate this bed, but my cat loves it. If he\'s being too quiet and I don\'t know where he is...he\'s in the bed. If I haven\'t seen him in 3 hours .. he\'s in the bed.  If I\'m lying in bed expecting to kick him on accident because I moved too quickly and he\'s been my bed buddy since day one, surprise! He\'s not there because he\'s in HIS bed!</></>I read some reviews similar to mine, but I foolishly though Not MY Cat! But unfortunately yes, my cat too has fallen prey to the witchcraft of this cat tree.</></>Good cat tree. Might need some extra velcro though, but my cat seems to love slipping around so what do I know?\n
 The cat in the picture is for sure a small cat. My cat isn\'t overweight or anything. I mean yeah maybe he could lose an ounce or two, but so could anyone. He fits inside the house part but he definitely couldn\'t groom himself on the top part - and no, not because he\'s too fat to groom himself.</>Also, the scratching post does not seem that tall.\n
 So the parts for this are good quality, the wood is solid and all the screw were provided. The mats are a little smaller then they look in the product image. The base of the tower, part &#8220;A&#8221; is missing its feet so it sits directly on the floor which is bad. The velcro to attach the pads to the tower don&# ;t work and there are only enough for one of the pads and the bed on top. I have a pretty small cat and she was able to move the pads around a lot with just the Velcro attaching them to the wood. I ended up having to glue them down which was disappointing.\n
 I have two kittens and one adult cat (15lb). They all love the cubby part at the bottom, but the top is really only big enough for the kittens (5lbs). I really like the modern design and complete lack of carpet :) The adult cat can fit all the way in the cubby at the bottom, he\'s just partially out in the photo because he wanted to pose for me ;) It\'s not easy to tip over, but if the cats jump from the top it does wobble a little due to lack of heavy weight at the bottom. The unit itself is sturdy. I\'d recommend, especially for smaller cats.\n
 Although our cat loves to sit on the top away from our pup the bed that comes with it is much smaller than the one shown. Not even coming close to the sharp corners. The Velcro to keep it on top is not great either. I had to buy a different bed to put ontop and protect the edges. The platform below is not quite big enough for the cat to use to lay on, or even use as a step to get to the top platform. It certainly looks great and perhaps would be better for smaller cats around 9lbs. Or if there is something else they can use to access the top platform. We use the bottom cuddle area to hold toys because it&# ;s a bit small for our cat and went unused.\n
 Super easy to put together. It&# ;s just a bit small. I have an adult female cat. They give you Velcro stickers to put underneath the bed, but they don&# ;t do anything. The bed slid right off. I had to get heavy duty double sided tape. The cubby is too small, she hates it. I love how modern it looks though. I wish they would provide more options for the bed colors. Tan does not do well with black cats. Overall, it&# ;s sturdy and looks nice. She loves sitting at the top.\n
 Unlike carpeted cat houses, this one is a wood-like material that I think looks more like a piece of furniture. It was easy to assemble, and my cat loves sitting on the perch and looking out the window. You can detach the bed and top piece for cleaning - a bonus!  Sturdy, and not too big, this is the perfect compromise for a smaller area.\n
 This cat tree condo is the perfect size for our little kitten Harlym. She\'s really petite like her mom and fits in the perch platform like it was custom built for her.</></>The pillows are really soft and very warm. She does not know what to do with the scratch post even after we tried to teach her so it\'s just there for now. I also got her a scratch wave and she\'s not interested in scratching that either.</></>Putting the cat tree condo together was a eeze. It took about 10 mins going real slow and reading all instructions. It probably could be done even without instructions. One panel had very minor imperfections in the laminate which is not really an issue as that side was flipped toward the interior of the condo so it\'s not visible except maybe to the kitten. The only panel that cannot be flipped around is the top one with the Catry gold color metal logo.</></>All in all, very happy with this purchase.</></>Catry Wooden Cat Tree Condo with Natural Sisal Rope Scratching Post for Kitten\n
 Kitty approved! Opened up the box and as soon as I laid the bedding on the floor one of my cats was snuggled on it. I am worried about the sturdiness as it seems to wobble a lot and my other cat is a 20lb kitty. Probably will try to add some weight some how and will be moved to a corner spot in room. Which is highly recommend for any cat tree.\n
 Noooo. I was into this tower. But not anymore. So bummed.</></>The second time I washed the bed, it literally shredded apart. Howww? It&# ;s very difficult to clean. The fur and dirt just collect into lint bundles on the surface. I cannot believe it tore open like this upon second wash.</></>It&# ;s impossible to contact company for new bed. If you&# ;re out there, can you rectify this damage?\n
 I&# ;ve had this long enough to say it&# ;s a complete success.  I wanted this for my kitty who likes to look out the window and it&# ;s the perfect height. It also has a small footprint so isn&# ;t in the way, plus it looks much nicer than most I&# ;ve seen.  All of the pads are removable so they can easily be washed.  They have Velcro bits to keep them in place and haven&# ;t budged even when my cat has made a flying leap onto it.  He&# ;s in the top bed all the time, not much use for the other levels but does sometimes use the scratching post.  Again, this isn&# ;t that big so may not be great if you have a couple large cats &#8211; mine is around 12 lbs and it&# ;s a perfect size for him.\n
 &#160;I love the quality of this cat tree and it was very easy to assemble...except that there were NO instructions included.  Minor inconvenience but I am very pleased with this cat tree.  It\'s perfect for my home office where my cat likes to hang out while I work.  Only other issue is that I feel it could be slightly taller but that would speak more to my particular application.  I placed it near a window and my cat took to it right away.  Highly recommend, as long as you\'re crafty or willing to seek out some helpful instructions.\n
 This is a very well-made and very stylish cat tree. However, my cat doesn\'t fit on it, anywhere. He\'s a very average-sized 5-year-old domestic shorthair. He curls up in the bottom cube for about 10 mins at a time but has to get out to move or adjust at all. It is VERY, very small, best for kittens. He jumped on the top part one time, which tipped it over due to how small it is.\n
 &#160;I spent over an hour lint rolling and using tweezers picking these black hairs off of the cushion and little white mats. Random white paint splatter than won&# ;t come off (see video and photos).  All the pieces came with scratched paint all over, NOT REAL WOOD, poorly painted fake wood with scratches all in the paint. Dingy scratched up metal logo that does not come off, not sure if this was a returned item that was sold as &#8220;NEW&#8221; or their quality control department needs to STEP IT UP! NOT WORTH THE PRICE! DISPLEASED OVERALL.\n
 The whole top section is rickety. Also, it really is too small for a large cat, if nothing else because of unstable design. My cat is around 12-13 lbs and only maybe a tad overweight. He wouldn&# ;t go near the thing.  It would be fine for a small cat probably under 10lbs. The directions were not clear where to put the washer - above or below the board that scratching post attaches too. Not sure it would matter tho regarding stability. The washer is too thick.\n
 We purchased this to allow the little one access to the window without getting on the table (cats are so hard to train).  It sort of worked. It took the Old Man cat a little longer to investigate. Several weeks in, he checked out the cubby for a few minutes,  and he\'s too big for the top of the cubby. Once he found he could get to the top bed (again,  he is big and getting older), he lives on it. Little one knows its OMs now and won\'t go up there :-D She just sits below and bats at his tail.\n
 Some part were chipped and the wood is not even wood but the worst part is it is not sturdy at all. My 8 pounds 10 months old kitty knocked it down. Bottom compartment is only comfortable for the kitty if you have any cats more than 10 pounds, they won&# ;t fit there. It was easy to assemble and I put it together myself but I would send it back if I wasn&# ;t too lazy to dissemble it. Not worth the money.\n
 This is such a sleek cat tower and a pretty sturdy one too, but unfortunately my two cats are too big for it. The one pictured (Onyx) is the only one who will use it. He\'ll only sleep in the bottom cubby and generally hangs halfway out of it in order to lay inside. If you have a small cat this is perfect for you! I\'m keeping this because Onyx honestly loves it, we\'ll just get another larger cat tower I guess. This is what we do for our cats.\n
 This was surprisingly great quality. Normally, cat trees are ugly and wobble. Not so with this one! It looks exactly like the photos.</></>This one has a faux wood veneer that actually looks very convincing. It\'s super sturdy. I assembled it in less than a half an hour, very simple.</></>It is compact in size, which is great if you don\'t want something huge in your living space. I have a 10 week old kitten and a 12 lb. adult cat. The box and top perch are large enough for my cat. The middle perch is the right size for my kitten. My kitten took to the scratching post right away.</></>I really appreciated the little details on this, like the Velcro stickies for the mats/bed and the 3M rubber tabs that ensure it doesn\'t scratch my floor.</></>The only things that could be improved is making the top perch a smidge larger and a few small aesthetic changes, but I would definitely buy it again.\n
 1st of all, received a returned product, w/o instructions, just parts jammed into a box.</></>Despite the lack of packaging,  the wood and faic parts were in excellent condition.  The hardware was in a zip lock bag.  Not sure if it came with the 2 Allen wrenches needed for assembly since they weren\'t in the bag.</></>Assembly was straight forward,  and the finished product is attractive  and sturdy.  It\'s a good size for small or medium sized cats.</></>Review score:</>Returned item, no packaging,  etc. 0 out of 5 stars</>Assembled item, 5 stars\n
 Have always wanted something like this... Cat furniture that looks nice in the house and doesn\'t cost a fortune! I was worried when this first came that the top level and bed was going to be too small for my large 12 pound cats. But they enjoy it very much. It took just minutes to put together and I like that the covers are easily washable and they have velcro to keep them in place.\n
 I love this tree as it matches my floors and it&# ;s not covered in ugly carpet like a lot of cat trees are! Our cat loves to sit on it and use it as a scratching post so she doesn&# ;t go inside the hole that much. Basically comes in the box it&# ;s packaged and when shipped so one of the corners of one of the pieces was chipped and I had to glue together in order to assemble so better packing would be a good suggestion to the company!\n
 My kitty condo arrived in perfect condition, was easy to put together, and my cat Dahlia loves it. Yes, it isn&# ;t huge- but that was a selling point for me. It&# ;s thick &#8220;wood&#8221; and feels very sturdy. I like that you put Velcro dots to keep pads in place, then if needed you can take the pads and wash them and dust the thing. (Unlike carpet ones which are allergy nightmares.) I needed mine to be level with the window (it is at 30&#8221;) and should I need it taller I could always add legs easily with a drill later. I love it! Five stars.\n
 Frankie likes it so how can I argue?</>It was very easy to assemble and feels sturdy.</>Not too expensive. Not hideous. Just as advertised. I appreciate that it came with some little sticky things with Velcro on one side to hold the mats in place. A nice detail so Frankie doesn&# ;t fly off the other side when he jumps on. I am getting some 6 inch hairpin legs to add to the bottom to lift the whole thing a little higher.\n
 Overall good. The upper section however is attached by one thick screw to the pole and also at lower end of pole which will allow it to rotate if not tightened very hard. The pillow for the top is different from the others and has sort of a curve to it which made it not stick to wooden plate as uniformly as the other perfectly flat cushions. Regardless&#8230;my three little stooges love it.\n
 My cat is 13 lbs.... This cat tree was way too small for her, so she really only used the middle platform. I tried to get her comfortable with the highest tier but she always comes down. Perhaps it feels too shaky for her? Also, she never goes into the little cubby hole either.... I figured that if she doesn\'t use most of it, it\'s not really a good fit. She does use the scratching post sometimes, but she prefers the cheap little cardboard lounger over that.</></>Overall, good for the price. Very esthetically pleasing. Just not the best for bigger cats who like to splay out when they\'re relaxing or looking out the window.\n
 The box on this is too shallow for the cat to fit inside comfortably. The material is of poor quality. Don\'t buy this. Spend a little more and get the Vesper cat tree, it\'s much higher quality and is heavier/sturdier and larger so that cats can actually fit inside of it comfortably. I regret buying this cat tree.\n
 My cat loves this!  I assembled it in 10 minutes with nothing other than what came in the box.  I love that the pads are attached by Velcro so that I can take them off and wash them as needed.  The house is very sturdy, and my 10lb cat climbs it without it wobbling.  She is a large cat, and I was worried that she wouldn&# ;t fit comfortably in the hole or top platform.  But within the first day I found her sleeping in each of those spots quite comfortably!  Finally, this cat condo looks great in our modern home.  I highly recommend it!\n
 Our cats are smaller, so they can fit inside the box or under the top post to use the scratching post. However, a larger cat might not appreciate this cat tower. I\'d give the product 5 stars, but deducted one for being smaller than advertised. It\'s a few inches shorter.\n
 This product is deceivingly too small. I have a regular 9lb Siamese cat and he was not able to lay down inside.</></>The top platform is also not very accommodating. I can only assume through deductive reasoning that the cat in the advertisement video was a young 6lb or cat.</></>Not worth the money. I would suggest going to Petco and personally choosing something larger.\n
 We&# ;ve got an older kitty, who now resides in the little kitty television at the bottom of this tree all of the time and a younger kitty who looms over his domain at the tippy top. This is a great little kitty tree, easy to assemble and very sturdy! I like it a lot.\n
 I was so excited about this cat tree, i love the color and its so sturdy! As i was assembling it i noticed that the wooden part at the top was missing!!! So disappointed. Now we have to disassemble it, return it and buy a new one, which is quite a hassle amd a waste of my time.\n
 The construction of this tree is not easy for my kitty to access the second shelf. Kitty didnt use it at all. He couldn\'t jump to the second shelf therefore it doesnt serve the purpose as a cat tree. Material was decent and looked cute, but that\'s about it. They make the second shelf almost parallel the first shelf .... Where is the space to jump on, unless you put it next to a chair or another shelf but then what\'s the point? Waste of time and money.\n
 A genuinely nice-looking piece of cat furniture. The kittens use all parts of it--scratching post, cubbyhole, shelf,  and top perch (their favorite part--they curl up in it together). I love the wood look and the fact that all the upholstery can be removed and washed/replaced. I\'m never going back to manky old carpet-covered cat trees again. Cat furniture makers, please design more like this!\n
 This cat tree is great. It was very easy to assemble and looks very sleek and modern. The quality was actually better than expected. I was worried that my cat would not be interested but as you can see, he loves it. The only suggestion I would make is to provide options for a larger cat tree. My cat is on the chunky side and would probably be more comfortable with a slightly larger top deck but overall it works great.\n
 Youngest got a cat for Christmas and realized cat needed something a little higher so he could look out windows without jumping all over furniture. It wobbles a little, bit I have it on carpet. He&# ;s a little chunky cat but he loves laying in the top and using the scratch post. Best of all, it doesn&# ;t look like a typical, &#8220;carpet&#8221; cat condo; it actually looks like it could be furniture. Super easy to assemble.\n
 It&# ;s sturdy and good-looking. My biggest cat is about 11lbs and fits on it just fine. My cats don&# ;t use it as much as I wish, but that&# ;s probably my fault for not putting it next to a window. I do catch one of them snoozing in the hut from tme to time (we put a little blanket in there to make it a bit more comfy.)\n
 Consider this a shout from the rooftops on how much I (and my little dude) love this tree! It\'s a great window vantage point and comfortable enough for him to luxuriate for hours at a time. Curious if it\'s possible to buy/replace specific parts? There\'s a hole in the pad that sits on top of the scratch post platform that exposes the stuffing, so I can no longer wash it! Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!\n
 Definitely petite/kitten size. Our cat is a 11 pound tabby, full grown. She mostly fits on the top and seems content to sit there for a few hours but cannot stretch out to sleep like she does on her other cat tree. It&# ;s also lightweight so she&# ;ll scoot it some when she jumps off.\n
 This cat tree is great! I have a pretty large cat, he\'s 12ish pounds, and I was worried that this would be way too small for him but he loves it! Its very sturdy and the perfect height for him to look out of the window! He fits in the box on the bottom but he doesn\'t really use it, being in small spaces is not his thing. The beds that come with it are super soft and easy to wash in the washing machine.\n
 Good looking cat tree from the universe of unsightly trees. I bought some velcro pieces to help the top bed stay attached. My kitten was a bit wary at first because the bed would slide when he jumped since the velcro included isn\'t that strong. The edges are also a bit sharp so I wouldn\'t recommend for tiny babies or as a standalone cat tree. He uses another cat tree to jump on to this one and it works fine. He likes to nap there often (he has many choices). He doesn\'t get much use out of the sisal pole.\n
 She got into the box before it was even finished being assembled.</></>Looking for our cat?...you will find her on her perch either staring out the window or all curled up in the cozy cushion.  She is a regular size adult cat. Cushion fits her perfectly. So glad we bought THIS one.\n
 We just adopted a 3 year old ragdoll cat and decided on this cat tower for her. Our ragdoll is on the smaller side weighing around 10 pounds. She seems to really like it so far. Still not very curious or confident to climb on the perch but I think she&# ;ll get there. The design is aesthetically pleasing and it&# ;s pretty sturdy.\n
 My cats like this and I like the look of it. It&# ;s quite small but I live in an apartment so thats what I was looking for. Not super sturdy but not terrible. Easy to assemble. All in all I like it a lot but I&# ;ll probably have to get something much larger at some point to keep my cats busy!\n
 My kitty loves and more importantly, so do I. It&# ;s so chic and beautiful and also very easy to assemble. I contacted the seller because I was missing a screw and they are shipping it to me and helped me immediately. Highly recommend!\n
 My cat naps on this for most of the day.  She only uses the top part and the scratching post but that\'s all we need.  I also feel like its a huge improvement style wise from my last cat tree, it looks nice in the house which I couldn\'t say about the last one I had.\n
 Slightly cheap materials and I&# ;m not a fan of how the pad at the top sits but cat enjoys laying on it more than her previous one. I like that the pieces are removable to wash. Definitely for a smaller cat.\n
 i was looking for something that would fit in my small apartment and not be an eye sore. This is the perfect window seat for him and gives him a comfy spot to hide his toys and snooze. My cat is large - weighs about 14 lbs and fits perfectly on the platform and in the box.\n
 My cats are now 1 yr and 3 months so they&# ;re not quite kittens but not full grown and they seemed to fit fine. The entire tree is on the smaller side which is what I wanted for my room but cats like to get in smaller spaces so they took to it quickly. They love it and have started to play and sleep on it as I was assembling it. Very sleek and modern which I love and seems easy to clean/vacuum cat fur off of it. Definitely sturdy too.\n
 Looked very nice, unfortunately the base oke after only 3 months!  The tube is nothing but cardboard wrapped in sisal, and oke in half. Not enough to hold a cat. Very disappointing. And of course oke 1 month outside my return window and I can\'t get in touch with the manufacturer.  I would not recommend.\n
 The first one I was sent was damaged but Amazon took care of it and sent me a replacement for free.</>The replacement I was sent was absolutely perfect and we LOVE it! Sooooo worth the money. I love that it&# ;s modern and clean looking and not too big for our house. Would for sure buy another.\n
 This cat tree is perfect. Not too big, not too expensive , very sturdy  &#1084;odern looking and good quality. Unfortunately, my kitten doesn\'t yet likes it but I am hoping he will line it in the future\n
 Cute. Super easy to assemble. Look modern &amp; stylist. I wish it can be a bit bigger, more like 15 x 15 x 15 so my cat can fit better. Now he is kinda squeeze in. Both on top &amp; bottom. My cat is 13 pounds &amp; well behave. So far he seem to adjust well with it. Please make a bigger version !!!!\n
 I can\'t even assemble this since the holes in the pieces that are supposed to be screwed together do not line up. I don\'t have my own drill to make new ones and I shouldn\'t need any tools aside from the ones included and on the instructions. At this point it\'s a matter of choosing the hassle of getting additional tools to finish the job or the hassle of returning this\n
 It looks like proper furniture and my cats, from seven to sixteen pounds, all use it in turn. I wish the padding was better attached, but that\'s a minor quibble.\n
 I just got a kitten (6 months) and was looking for a smaller &#8220;cat tree&#8221; to get him started with heights in my house. It&# ;s the perfect perching spot for him at the window and the cushions are actually soft, durable and so easy to clean in the wash. Scratching post is great too and after a little over a month of use it&# ;s still intact and doesn&# ;t shed too much. Highly recommend!\n
 A bit cheaply made but my cat is getting a bit older and her tall one was too hard to reach. This is perfectly level with my window and she LOVES it! Especially cause it&# ;s also level with my desk and she likes to watch me!\n
 I have a very small apartment and wanted a cat tree that would fit with my modern aesthetic and not be obtrusive.  I LOVE this tree. It came in a small box (16 lbs) and was very easy to assemble alone.  I have two cats: 1 is 10lbs and the other is 8 lbs.  Only one of them can fit inside the box at a time, which is no issue. The insert for the box is very cozy and thick. The liners for the top of the box and the top of the tree are actually much nicer than what I would have anticipated -- pretty cushy.  The unit comes with Velcro stickers to affix the pads and covers for the bottom box\'s screws so they don\'t mess up the floor.  Both of my cats love the tree (and so do I)!  I would definitely recommend this to friends.\n
 I am livid. We put this whole thing together then noticed this crack. I&# ;m not taking the whole thing apart to get a new one. I want a replacement part\n
 I bought this cat tree because the faic can be removed and cleaned. I also liked the style. The cat tree is sturdy enough since we only have one cat and she does not jump off of it too much. I only wish it were slightly bigger. She can barely fit on the top shelf.\n
 This is a great tree. It was super easy to assemble and is quite sturdy. We have 11 cats and they all use it.</>I\'ve built a lot of different cat trees and this one was by far the easiest and so well made. I would definitely buy this again.\n
 I ordered the second generation pattern which showed a rich wooden color -but it was the light color.</>It was easy to assemble and I like that you can wash the pads\n
 Top part doesn\'t stay in place and cat falls quiet often. This thing looks ok but some design seems like not correct like the box is too small.\n
 Is nice, but my cat didn\'t used it ones since I bought it!</>I think the first reason is because when she tried to jump the structure moved a lot, and that scared my cat.</>Came with a little chips in the corners.\n
 This cute piece is a great value and much to my surprise my cats got in it instead of the box as soon as it was assembled.  I give it four paws up!\n
 Was worried it be a bit small for my slightly larger (12 pound long hair) cat, but he fits on top &amp; inside the bottom box just fine. He seems to like it. Only wobbles a tiny bit when he jumps on top. Was pretty easy to put together, seems sturdy, and looks nice.\n
 I ordered this to put in kitchen window. I wanted something with less faic. This works great, but I just wish it was a bit larger. It was easy to put together.  As my 22 lb and 12 lb cat sleeps on it. It&# ;s easy to keep clean. For this size, the price should of been a little cheaper.\n
 This is good for really small cats however any cat bigger than 10 pounds will not fit. I\'m pretty disappointed because the images shared are really deceiving. My cat doesn\'t even fit in the bottom compartment :(\n
 My cats are obsessed with this cat tree. I got it so that they could watch me work and stay off of my desk. I was happy to see it&# ;s just about desk height. It&# ;s worked very well. Both of my cats are large (15 pounds or so) as you can see in the photo. They seem to still find it pretty comfortable. They even use the box for napping. Thumbs up.\n
 I was surprised that within a week we actually had all levels being used!  Sturdy and clean, especially since you can throw the pads in the wash (they&# ;re attached with Velcro, which is a bonus, lol). Really looks like a piece a furniture.\n
 The cat doesn&# ;t like it she never gets on it also it&# ;s a little wobbly at the top but it&# ;s still really pretty rather than the carpet covered eyesores of cat trees\n
 I was hoping my cat (6months old) would use it. And yes he does use it !! He sleep ever night on the top and use it to do is claws!! We have it since a months or so and he still doesn&# ;t use the &#8220;inside bed&#8221;.</>I&# ;m very satisfied with the purchase. And the dosing is very nice.\n
 I loved this product when I first got it, but once my kitten was about 7 months old, he had already outgrown it. Beautiful but not practical for adult cats.\n
 seemed to be wobbly even though we went over and over making sure everything was tightened. Also the cushion kept sliding and my cat fell and never wanted anything to do with it again\n
 Looks great! Cats never use it unless I put treats on it. Easy to put together but the top swivels no matter how hard we tighten it.\n
 One of my cats likes to climb up the trim of our windows the watch birds. Thus, I bought this item to try and prevent her climbing. She LOVES this and is constantly sitting on it watching outside. I definitely recommend putting it near a window for cats to watch the outside world. I am considering buying another because can\'t beat the price and I think my other cat needs one too lol.\n
 Looks like a great product but I received damaged and can&# ;t really assemble. I was going to return it but the only option is to take it to a specific place that is far from me. I&# ;m sure it happened during the delivery but the product wasn&# ;t safely packed to protect it. Too bad &#128532;\n
 I really like the look of this cat tree.  No attached carpet on it to get all furry.  It has 3 separate lounging pads that you can remove to wash.  It goes well with my decor too.  Not an obvious cat tree sitting in the room.\n
 It was my bad, I didn&# ;t pay attention to the dimensions and I waited too long to return it for a refund.  So I&# ;m stuck with a step stool for the cats to reach the window. I would recommend this for a kittens first few months.  Not recommend for average size cats.\n
 My cats have tipped this over more than once jumping energetically to the top shelf so I am returning it.\n
 This was on sale when I got it, but it exceeded all expectations regardless of price. The structure is sturdy and the pads are comfortable. Velcro secures them into place.  It looks good in our home and doesn\'t take up a ton of room which would make our house look like a crazy cat house.</></>Perfect for our two kittens.\n
 Packaging was adequate, very easy to assemble (Allen keys provided). It&# ;s sturdy and looks nice. The color/shade is a little lighter than pictured, but not so much that I&# ;d consider returning it. Just keep in mind that there may be color/shade variation in the type of laminate that they use at the factory.\n
 It&# ;s definitely looks a lot bigger in the pictures. It&# ;s very cute though I just wish it was bigger.\n
 Nice looking product and seems very sturdy. I would say if you have a larger cat, they may not fit. My cat is 9LB and just fits in the bed.\n
 Assembly went very smoothly. The moment it was completed my cat marched over and went directly inside the box. It is heavy enough to be sturdy. I\'m not sure how my cats will use the sisel scratching post.\n
 My cat will sleep in the top forever. It comes up to just about the height of my desk. She uses the very bottom or the very top and doesn\'t scratch on the post.\n
 This tree is way overpriced for what it is, and not that well made. However, it does look nice and fits in the small area I bought it for. So I appreciate the size\n
 My cat is 12 years old and can\'t jump as high as she used to, so I wanted to get her something easy to climb on. This little mini-tree is the perfect height for the window, and she loves it! I was worried she might find the lower box too cramped, but she goes in and sleeps in there all the time. Happy cat!\n
 It tries to tip over when a cat runs and jumps up to the top portion. Now my cats are afraid of it.\n
 Replacement for an older carpet version. I like it because it has cleaner lines and fits in with decor. Cat loves relaxing on top and interior section.\n
 Zero interest in the cave part, all about the perch by the window. I would say though it is made for smaller cats, she isn\'t large but is known to hang off it a bit.\n
 if you have a large cat it will definitely wobble on them. I suggest putting a weight on the bottom from keeping it from tilting over if your cat is anything over 15lbs and jumps on it.\n
 I ordered this for my cat because I wanted a cat tree that looked a little nicer than most. It wasn\'t until after I ordered it that I saw it was described to be for kittens. It is on the smaller size but my adult Siamese can comfortably fit inside and on the top. It looks really nice and it was easy to assemble. As I was putting it together my cat already jumped in!\n
 I love this ! It&# ;s super stylish for a cat accessory. My cats really enjoy it as well. My cats are both full grown (11-13lbs) &amp; my male cat is too big to fit in the box in the bottom but still loves playing on it !\n
 My cats are now afraid of it because it was too wobbly when they tried to play on it.  Maybe better for small cats.\n
 This was super easy to assemble. It isn\'t the highest quality materials but it looks nice and clean\n
 I didn&# ;t expect this to be such high quality because of the price. Most of these cat trees are just carpeted and cost more. I wanted something that would look nice out in my living room and this one is great. I didn&# ;t read the description well though and it was a little smaller than expected. I have a kitten and a 23 pound fat cat. This tree is great for smaller cats!!! But fat*ss can&# ;t fit &#128514;\n
 My cats liked this cat tree a lot! We used it as their constant structure when we were moving apartments and they had to spend some time in hotels. They still love it even after we\'ve settled into our new place. We placed the velcro that keeps the bed in place in a weird way but they are pretty strong once they\'re on there so make sure you know where you want it.\n
 She loves the perch. Probably spends a quarter to half her day in it. She uses the scratcher when she remembers it\'s there (I have others), it\'s rare that she uses the condo but the perch is at the window, so why would she?\n
 Modern style cat tree. Our cat is 11 pounds and she fits comfortably in the box, on the box or on the bed on top. Pretty simple to put together.\n
 This works perfectly for our new kitten!  We put it in front of a bedroom window and he loves it!  I did have to add some extra tape to keep the padding on top, and it is not all that big. A large cat would not fit.\n
 Looks great! I got this for our newly adopted kittens. They&# ;re so young, not roaming the house yet, &amp; not using this yet, but it was easy to assemble &amp; it feels sturdy.\n
 I have a small cat and her first time using it, she toppled it over so now she wants nothing to do with it. Sending it back.\n
 Very sturdy and out cats love it! They were very excited to use it as soon as we finished building it. It was very simple to assemble as well.\n
 This looks very nice, however I have a large cat so, he doesn\'t really fit in it!! He does like looking out of the window from the top.\n
 Wood construction so it can sit outside on my screened in porch without getting nappy and wet with the humidity. 14#kitty is almost too big for it, but he loves it. I find him in or on it all the time.\n
 Absolutely beautiful cat tree. It&# ;s perfect for a kitten due to its size. My favorite thing is that it&# ;s not an ugly piece of furniture and my kitten enjoys it! Is super easy to put together and it&# ;s very sturdy. I took one star off because the product came with a small crack.\n
 Way too small and flimsy. Maybe for a kitten or small cat. Useless.\n
 this product is horrible. The bottom box is too small for a cat to climb/jump to the next level\n
 Tower seems good enough though the box it was shipped in was flimsy and torn apart, no instructions to build came with it, and it\'s also missing the top bed and three screws. Screws and tools were in this toy fish bag. Catry, send me the missing pieces please?\n
 I had to put shipping tape on the top from my from sliding off. Do not recommend. My cat is deaf and has slid off it many times. I tried to bolt the bed to the wood, but it splintered. Horrible.\n
 The cat tree cane with easy-to-follow instructions and took 20 minutes to build. Our 17-pound cat fits snugly in the box (he loves small spaces) and can easily jump and snooze on the top tier without it wobbling. It looks great in our living room and more high-end than typical cat trees. Highly recommend!\n
 Our cat doesn&# ;t take advantage of the lower cubby too much, but it&# ;s the perfect height for our window and she loves napping in it and watching the birds. Rambunctious jumping can knock it over, but it&# ;s fairly sturdy and easy to assemble.\n
 This cat tree looks fairly nice and it&# ;s really easy and quick to put together. I think it took me all of 10 minutes. That being said, it is pretty small. I read the reviews before I bought it and thought this was probably going to be the case. I have a big Maine Coon cat and he doesn&# ;t fit it all (see photo) but luckily my little 7lb cat fits it perfect. Nice cat tree for the price\n
 Easy to assemble and is very good quality.  My Kitty loves the top shelf with the padded bed on top.  She isn\'t too interested in the cubbie at the bottom, but she spends a lot of time up top.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Velcro provided was not sufficient, but I purchased heavy duty double stick Velcro (about $4) and its perfect.  Also, I wish it was slightly larger, but overall I\'m very pleased with this purchase.\n
 Got this so it would match my bedroom decor a little better than a typical tree. It\'s super cute! My cat really only uses the top perch and it could be a little bigger (she\'s kinda chub so she doesn\'t fit the best on it). But overall a really nice tree for the price, and it\'s super cute too\n
 My cats love the new cat tree and it was super easy to assemble. One of the bolts I received was missing the spot for the allen key &amp; their customer service kindly sent out a new set of parts.\n
 Do not buy this! I have had it 2 months and it oke. My cat fell because this oke.  DO NOT BUY!\n
 Love the look of this. Very modern.</>Easy to assemble.</>Would buy again.\n
 Cats love the top of the tower. They don&# ;t seem interested in the bottom cubby but it looks so chic I don&# ;t care.\n
 Top tray are small for a adult cat, materials and finish are cheap\n
 Easy to assemble and sturdy. My only complaint is that the pad on the upper shelf tends to slide off when my cat jumps on/off. I plan to add double sided tape under the pad to prevent this. Other than this, I think it&# ;s a good value for the price.\n
 Great product! The wood conforms well to most furniture, and it was a eeze to assemble. Cat loves it already, we put her at the top once we ought it in, and she instantly laid down.\n
 Washable/ removable pads\n
 It is the cutest cat house on the market for this price.  My cat lays on the top two areas but hasn&# ;t dared go inside yet &#128514;\n
 Love this little cat tree! My Gizzy loves it too.  She took to it right away.\n
 My cat absolutely loves her little house, and getting her something she will use is worth five stars in and of itself. The tower is beautiful, sturdy, and assembled easily and sits nice and flat. The wood pattern really elevates the traditional cat tower to a lovely piece of furniture.\n
 She loves it &#128525;&#9829;&#65039;&#128591;\n
 My cats love it. It&# ;s super easy to put together. It&# ;s stable, and the perfect size and best part is, it&# ;s not ugly!\n
 So sturdy and nice looking! I didn&# ;t know if my cats would be fans, but they all love it and clamor for the top bed by the window!\n
 Opened it up to find stains all over it&#8230; reordered and will hopefully get a new one..\n
 Very nice.\n
 My cat loves it. Its well made.\n
 My cats love it. The bottom box part is too small for my 20 pounds cat, but she loves stay up on the tower.\n
 my cat loves to perch on the window! she&# ;s not a huge cat but she can&# ;t curl up into a ball on the window sill so I bought this in hopes to get her a window side spot for her to get comfy in it. the top of the tree hits my window sill perfectly and Alamo is absolutely FASCINATED by it. She&# ;s been laying in it all day long and can&# ;t get enough.\n
 Tama&#241;o adecuado y f&#225;cil de armar. Buena compra.\n
 This cat tree is cute, and good quality.  My only complaint is that my cat doesn\'t fit in the bottom part that great so she isn\'t interested in it at all.  She is 12 pounds. She doesn\'t even try to use the scratch post.  I think this would be perfect for a kitten or smaller adult cat.\n
 Super tiny so if you have a large cat...it won\'t work. Perfect for tiny kittens\n
 Easy to put together. Very sturdy.  Highly recommend\n
 Cats like it! I love the modern minimalist look.\n
 It&# ;s a beautiful cat tree that was super easy to assemble. Unfortunately it&# ;s too small for my cat. He barely fits in the bottom enclosed part, and he can&# ;t seem to get comfortable. I wish it was a little bigger since it really is a beautiful, sleek, modern cat tree. It&# ;s worth the money if your cat is on the smaller side I guess.\n
 looks better then the other towers I saw\n
 Just got delivered this morning and both of my cats are loving it &#128077;\n
 I like the clean look of this product.  Cat loved it slept it in for hours soon as we built it.\n
 I was very pleased with how adorable and functional this is!!\n
 My cat sleeps at the top of the condo all day! The frame is sturdy and the pillows are soft. Took me less than 15 minutes to assemble myself.\n
 The Kween loves her new catsle. Props to the 8 y/o peasant child for assembling it.\n
 Looks great and my cat loves it too! It&# ;s small but not too small.\n
 Way smaller than described...at least I think it looks small based off the bed cushion. Wouldn&# ;t know about the size of it because none of the screws fit so I can&# ;t even put it together.\n
 Item as described. Easy to put together and doesn&# ;t look super tacky. More like a piece of furniture\n
 He loves it!</>The bottom box is a bit small for my cats, but they all love the upper case. Thus giving a 5star :)\n
 Nice clean looking, very easy to assemble\n
 She absolutely loves it! It&# ;s the perfect height, the bedding parts are really soft and plush, and it was really easy to put together. It&# ;s also super sturdy which was important for us because she&# ;s pretty skittish and the smallest wobble scares her. I&# ;d definitely recommend this product!\n
 Cute cat tower, unfortunately came damaged.\n
 Cute and modern but the top cushion is little smaller than what I expected. Price is little expensive for the size but bought it during the coupon promo..\n
 The enclosure and canopy are quite small. Would work great for kittens, but they would soon outgrow it.\n
 My cat is on it 80% of the time, loves it\n
 Received this cat tree two days ago. It really surprised me with its impressive looking and high quality. My cat can&# ;t wait to jump on it at the moment I finished assembling. It is easy to put together as where. Now, she stays on it all day long. It&# ;s also very stable, don&# ;t have to worry about falling out like my previous one.\n
 this works great for my kitties. My bigger can&# ;t fit in the bottom compartment &#129315; but overall its fun\n
 The nails were extremely hard to get in. Seemed like they didn&# ;t even fit. Not sturdy at all and I can hear my cats jump on it every night because of how wobbly it is\n
 Was not sturdy at all. My 9lbs cat jumped onto it once and almost knocked it over. I returned it.\n
 Overall pretty good, came slightly damaged with the bottom entrance lining but I was able to fix that myself. Assembly is very straightforward. Will update after cats use it\n
 Great quality and easy to build.\n
 Easiest thing Iij have assembled in a while. My kitty is a very large kitty. She weighs 20 pounds a d fits comfortably in the hidey hole.\n
 This cat tree could only hold a small cat!\n
 It&# ;s cute but my cat doesn&# ;t touch it. Not sturdy so he doesn&# ;t feel safe jumping on the top\n
 My cat didn&# ;t like it, plus it was too small for her\n
 Super n&#237;tido, la verdad es que se como en la foto.\n
 Really easy to assemble, great quality as well!</>My cat is too big to fit comfortably, but he still loves it! (Fyi, he is 16lbs. best for cats under 10lbs)\n
 Exactly as described. Good quality, looks nice. Cat loves it.\n
 They love it and it&# ;s not bulky!\n
 No complaints, pretty easy to assemble. My cat hates all furniture and beds I buy for him, but he likes this one. Appears to be good quality and it\'s so stylish! I\'d recommend giving it a shot.\n
 It was literally delivered to me with the wood oken in 3 places. Is it really that cheap?  Wtf??\n
 Pretty good cat tree for the price. So far it&# ;s pretty sturdy, and both my cats like to sleep on the top. The only con is that it&# ;s kind of a pain to put together.\n
 Product was received damaged and unable to place the bottom cat box together properly, made of horrible pressboard.\n
 In love!!! Worth every penny!\n
 My kitten loves it, it&# ;s super easy to put together.\n
 It was easy to assemble, looks nice. But the door way is super flimsy. oke so easily, it&# ;s made of thin fake wood\n
 &#160;Love it. Small crack on the wood but not really noticeable unless you&# ;re super close. Love the wood and the color, just like the pictures!\n
 sisal tube not made right made it set crooked.\n
 I love this! Very good quality and very easy to assemble. I will probably be buying a second one for another room in my home.\n
 My cat loved this cat tree!!\n
 Speaks for self!\n
 My kitty loves it! She\'s sleeping in it most of the day.\n
 Slighty smaller than expected but great for the price, great if you live in a small space as I do. Super easy to assemble, only took about 10mins and it looks great.\n
 Quick delivery and super good quality\n
 2 15lbs cat can fit!\n
 Perfect little modern cat tree. He loves it!:)\n
 My cats like it\n
 My cat loves it!!!! &#129392;&#129392;\n
 Great value. Setup in 30 minutes and very sturdy.\n
 Nice cat tree but too small even for my kitten. It\'s quite difficult for a cat to go from tier 1 to 2.\n
 It looks really nice and my cats love it.\n
 Very easy to assemble. Its well designed, easy to clean, and very sturdy.\n
 Easy to assemble and clean design.  Our girl liked it immediately.\n
 Easy set up cat loves it\n
 Small\n
 Just a little more weight for the balance\n
 My cats love it\n
 Attractive cat tree that is hypoallergenic. I love that you can wash all the soft pieces unlike traditional cat trees. Unfortunately, my cat does not seem interested in it. Definitely not for a big cat. 6 month kitten fits in it well, I can\'t imagine a cat bigger than 12lbs fitting comfortably on the top piece.\n
 Great price and the  cats &#128008; love it!\n
 Very cheap. I wasn&# ;t even able to assemble it because screws were missing.\n
 Not a bad tree just not for cats above 10lbs.\n
 The bed on top of the perch does not stay put and when it came loose, my kitten fell and hit her head.  The bed should have an elasticized bottom that fits over the perch securely, like my other tree.  I liked this product otherwise, but now I can\'t use it.\n
 My cat really like it, she stay there all day. This cat tree match my furniture very well. And the quality of this cat tree is nice and stable!\n
 My friend bought the cat tree for my cat, very nice quality and very perfect size for my bedroom!\n
 Great item, car loves too use it...\n
 &#160;I requires a mallet to assemble because the screws will not screw in all the way with the device that is provided. Once the screws are partially in, and every thing is level, use the mallet to beat the screws in the rest of the way. It requires alot or force! It is however, very stable as you can see my fat cat is rolling around on it quite happily.\n
 This tree is a great size. Wonderful for smaller spaces or to blend into decor. It comes up to the windowsill so it&# ;s PURRFECT for sunbathing. I assembled it, with Odin&# ;s help, in about 30minutes. It&# ;s great quality and sturdy. Odin is about 10lbs and spends his days securely lounging on the top. I receive compliments on his tree constantly and would definitely buy this again.\n
 My cats love sleeping on the podium bed. They don&# ;t particularly love sleeping inside the bottom box so unfortunately it&# ;s mostly a waste. However, you can use it as a pseudo-ottoman. They also don&# ;t seem to be keen on using the scratching post compared to a cardboard or cloth scratching post. The construction is excellent and it looks great in any room of our house. It is a bit on the pricey side, but worth it.\n
 Finally he can see out the window and its also matches my aesthetic  haha . I bought this for my apartment makeover video for youtube and I\'m not disappointed  at all.\n
 My boy loves his new cat tower. He laid on the bed pad as soon as we got it out of the box. VERY easy to assemble, comes with everything you need. Definitely more attractive than your average cat tree. Pictured is my 5lb kitten; my 15lb adult cat has shown little interest and seems a little too big to enjoy the tower. Would not recommend for cats weighing over 15lb!!!\n
 I loooove it clean, washable, easy sturdy looks nice perfect for multiple cats\n
 The bottom is for smaller cats, but it&# ;s easy to install and very sturdy\n
 It\'s small but my cats love it! It\'s perfect for my older cat to be able to bird watch.\n
 Honestly, I&# ;m surprised how sturdy this car tree is. It is a bit small but my 12lb cat fits pretty well and seems to enjoy it. The little cave part is a bit small but is nice. Very easy to assemble. Took me about 10 minutes.\n
 High quality, great purchase, looks better than pictured.\n
 Cat loves it and naps on and in it every day!\n
 I didn\'t know if my cat would be too big for the top or box, but she fits just fine on both. She tends to not go inside, but spends almost all day long on the top of the tower. Exactly what she wanted for window-watching, and light enough to move around\n
 Cats love it. Nice looking cat tower.\n
 Our kittens love it.\n
 Love this! I got it to encourage her to stay off my desk when I&# ;m working. Put it right next to the window and she immediately loved it. Incredibly easy to put together and not too big!\n
 my kitten loves it and it goes in my room nicely! great for the price !\n
 Exactly as pictured and great quality.\n
 The tree is very nice and sturdy! It&# ;s a great value for the money as similar products sometimes sell for much more, so in my opinion it&# ;s a nice find. Our tree came with a missing piece, so the seller mailed it out almost immediately and sent a nice cat toy with it! Overall we are happy with this item and product support.\n
 Very cute and easy to assemble, my kittens love it!!\n
 Easy assembly and very modern looking.  I upgraded to a larger one but this is great for tiny kittens or seniors who can&# ;t climb high.  The box is small so fat cats beware.\n
 This is the second time I have purchased this triple post scratching &#8220;tree&#8221; for my three cats.  When I purchased my leather sofa, I invested heavily in various items for them to scratch on.  THIS was their fav!  It only lasts about 3 months but for 3 cats, but I am pleased.  Very easy to assemble!  Both times the box was delivered with large tears/openings.  They need to package the product in more sturdy shipping boxes.  I WILL purchase again!!!\n
 This works great for my large cat of 20 pounds to use as a step.</>He also likes to lay on top of it. I put some heavy duty double sided tape over the 3 bottom bolt heads. The bolt heads are not countersunk. Did not want to scratch my tile and needed to keep it from moving. My 20 pound cat can get crazy wild.</>His little sister of 12 pounds doesn&# ;t really need the step but she likes using and laying on it. She does use the carpet post to scratch on. Both play with the balls when laying on top. I am very happy with the purchase. Serves my purpose using it as a step. It is also the perfect height for a step and looks nice. I purchased the grey.\n
 This cat scratching toy was easy to assemble! My cat was sitting on the parts while I was putting it together because she couldn&# ;t wait to play with it. She finally wore herself out scratching the posts and playing with the fuzzy balls. She&# ;s about 8 lbs and almost 14 years old.\n
 It fit my (and the cat\'s) needs. I just needed a small one by the door so the cat can sit and look out. She knew what it was for when I put it there. Plus she needed new scratching posts and this has three nice ones. It\'s pretty sturdy. I sit on it to put my boots on and off.\n

 It\'s awesome but my new cat isn\'t interested.  LOL. I\'ll give him some time to warm up to it.  I do recommend!\n
 my cat loves it.  she likes to lay on top of it and hang off the side to scratch (yes my cat is weird)  I have 4 scratching post and she uses all of them but sleeps on this one a lot\n
 The piece itself once fully assembled is solid and stable which is what we were looking for, but the downside is it was missing one of the assembly screws and we literally watched as one of our cats took a swipe at the orange ball and it went flying apart literally less than 5 mins after it was fully assembled.  If you are just looking for a small scratching post for your cats it is fine, as long as you get all of the parts to assemble it, but I would not rely on the toys lasting too long, they seem to be poorly made and loosely attached.  If not for the missing part and shoddy toy quality it would be a solid 4-5 star piece.\n
 Love the product it&# ;s little but very fitting for my 3 cats thank you so much\n
