 Two of my cats loved to climb my old scratching post and attempt to sit atop.  I saw a photo of my friends cat on this scratcher and I asked her where in the world she found it and bought it for myself.  It\'s super tall - if I stand next to it and my cat is sitting on top, my cat is almost as tall as me and I\'m 5\'4!  It gives them lots of scratching room to stretch out, to climb, to stand on top and it\'s super thick around and very sturdy.  Seriously, this is the best scratching post you could ever find and if you\'re in need of one for your cats - get it.  Get it now!  Video attached of my silly cat chasing his tail on top of the scratcher.\n
 I ordered this scratching post because I have a large cat and wanted something durable. It had great reviews and others commented it was great for big cats- perfect, I ordered it. Two days later it was here and I literally laughed as I put it together. Assembly was easy and the product is sturdy...... but it is HUGE. Laughable huge. Good product, I would absolutely recommend. Just be aware that it\'s massive. I included a picture for scale. &#128514;\n
 &#160;My kitty is having so much fun on this cat tree! She loves the Pom Pom the best. I\'m worried she will wear it out soon! It\'s is very sturdy and hasn\'t wobbled at all when she jumps on and off of it. The faic is thick and she scratches the canvas as well as the scratch area. Assembly was very simple as well.  The color had tans and beige and isn\'t just black and white like the photo shown but it is very pretty in person and looks much more expensive than it was. The round bed piece is nicely padded inside for extra kitty comfort too. Great buy &amp; happy entertained cat!\n
 If you want happy, magical kitties, then buy this! This purchase was made based on height. The larger towers seem a hazard to me, especially with two active kitties. This is the perfect height! I am also able to move it around the house more easily then the traditional tower style. Our cats love to spring up on the platform, or into the tunnel. They enjoy laxing on this as well as they watch us go about. They bat at each other and the fluff ball that hangs nearby. They love to scratch their nails on it as well. The material has exceeded my expectation and does not leave any carpet fibers or fuzz behind for my kitties to be naughty and chomp on. Great play design for all magical kitties!!\n
 It took my cats a while to warm up to this scratching post. Perhaps they were intimidated by the sheer size of it; the thing is absolutely massive. For the first month they more or less ignored it, and it simply took up space -- a lot of space, did I mention it was massive? -- in my upstairs hallway. Then they started using it, a few scratches here, a few scratches there. Now it gets use multiple times a day for a bit of good scratching time. The younger, spryer cat likes to scale it with her claws and then perch atop it, like an Egyptian princess. And they do seem to appreciate the ability to get a good stretch in while using it. So, all in all, a good purchase.</></>NINE MONTH UPDATE: After nine months the cats are still loving this. I have it in a hallway they pass through a lot and they are always stopping to get a good scratch in. The small cat still loves to scale it and perch atop. Great addition to the house!</></>TWO YEAR UPDATE: The older cat (who isn\'t all that old but is lazy) is no longer interested in this post. There are a lot of scratching posts in the house and there is another, smaller set of posts that are part of a climbing multi-platform tree that he prefers. But the younger cat (now about 3-4 years old) still loves it and plays with it all the time! She still enjoys scaling it like she\'s climbing a tree, and perches gargoyle-like atop it. And it\'s held up very well over the years.\n
 My Mainecoons love this scratching post.  Nice to have something big enough for them.  My photo shows our old store bought scratcher next to this one</>Update: after 5 years it&# ;s seen better days but still holding strong and the cats still love it\n
 I just received this cat tree and set it up in less than 5 minutes.  Overall it seems sturdy, it might be a tiny bit wobbly though.  I&# ;m not sure how it will hold up over time but I really love the wicker details and for the price this is one of the best options I&# ;ve found.  Most of these style cat trees are over $100 and this one was around $75 at the time I purchased it.  I would definitely purchase another cat tree made by this company in the future.</></> There are 3 main pieces you have to screw together and then the 2 beds that are separate pieces.  I appreciate being able to remove the cushions since cat hair can collect, and it&# ;s so hard to clean off the other style that are more like carpet.  This style allows you to use your own bed if you want and easily wash the bedding.</></>My cats love it already and these two usually can&# ;t stand being near each other.  I&# ;ll update this review if I have any issues over the next couple months.\n
 Don\'t put this anywhere near water.  Don\'t purchase if your cats pee on things - destroys the product and voids the warranty.</></>Core of scratching post (the structural element) is made of pressboard (pressed recycled paper), which turns to mush when wet or even damp.</></>Cats peed on the bottom part of the post, which then disintegrated and oke off.  (Luckily none of the cats was hurt.  The interior of the bottom part of the post, underneath the faux fur cover, is made of ""pressboard" - recycled paper strips pressed together.  Once wet, it became mushy and fell apart.)</></>Bought this 2 months ago.  $45 for 2 months use is not good value.  Sad.  :(</>Until it crumbled, this post was great - cats loved it (, and apparently MARKED it), and used it until it fell.</></>Re:  the "one-year warranty":  Called &amp; was told it probably would not cover this, because my cats peed on the post.  Okay.  But cats often pee on things.  The consumer expects a cat toy to withstand cat pee, as well as scratching &amp; climbing.</></>(This is comparable to a baby toy manufacturer saying it has no responsibility for what happens if a baby puts the toy in its mouth or does any of the other things babies universally do.)</></>Mfr\'s rep told me I am welcome to send in photos, with a my product number and a copy of my receipt, and MAYBE they will do something for me - but probably not.  That\'s a lot of trouble when I\'ve already been told the cat pee basically voids the warranty.  (I mean, who would ever think a cat would pee on its toy?  Other than most cat owners....)\n
 Ideally, I\'d subtract one-half star because the unit is a bit wobbly by design.  The base is the same size as the two platforms above it; perhaps if it was a bit bigger it would provide more of a solid foundation.  I placed it next to a wall for more stability.  Once my cats got used to the slight movement as they jumped onto it, it was fine.  They use each of the levels and even my 19 lb. thug of a cat likes to squeeze himself into the hideout on the bottom.  Assembly was a eeze, requiring only a screwdriver (allen wrench is included).  There are a couple of plastic caps to cover the two exposed screw heads.  These kept coming off so I glued them on, solving the problem.  The black portions are a plush faic and vacuum easily.  The biggest selling point for me was the fact that this isn\'t just another ugly piece of cat furniture - it actually looks great!  Perfect for small to medium-sized cats...okay for bigger cats who think they are small.\n
 I have seen numerous reviews whining that the double-ended screw for putting the top basket\'s post onto the platform below is "too short". But it isn\'t! The only thing wrong is the instructions. They say to get a flat head screwdriver and tighten the bolt in all the way, then attach the post. It won\'t work to do that. What I did was screw it down into the platform just enough for it to get a firm grip, then I threaded the post on and there was enough bolt sticking up that the post could grip the bolt too. Then by turning the post, both ends of the bolt tightened in as far as they could sucking the post down firmly onto the platform. No screwdriver needed and certainly no trip to the hardware store or call to the manufacturer trying to obtain a similar but longer bolt.</></>What else can I report on? Of course I do wish there was an option to have plain faic rather than this tacky stuff, but maybe some day I will recover it. And though a question asking if the posts were solid wood got the reply that they are, causing me to choose this over one half the price that had cardboard tubes with plastic end caps- this indeed has cardboard tubes with plastic end caps. So I am pretty bummed I splurged for the expensive tower and got low quality anyway. The shelves are also cardboard so there\'s that formaldehyde stink but we painted the exposed part with sealant. Nothing we can do about the fumes coming out through the faic except keep the window next to the tower open for as long as we can until winter forces us to close it. At least it is less stinky than a carpet covered tower. The baskets seem to have a real wood bottom which is maybe what I saw in a pic that had me thinking the whole thing was made of real wood. Naw, it\'s your standard cheap, nasty cat tower. So don\'t get your hopes up.</></>The good thing about it is that it seems heavy enough to not tip over, unlike the Armarkat one I got years back, that my 6-pound kitten keeps toppling. And the glue used doesn\'t offgas, like that and. This is at least better than those!</></>And the baskets are cute of course. The cushions for in them are way too thin so I plan to open them up and add some stuffing once I get around to it.</></>Keep in mind the center of the top basket is quite offset from the center of the base so if you want to squeeze this around a night stand or other obstruction that can be a useful strategic detail. or if you forget and plan on it being straight up you might end up frustrated.\n
 This cat tree was pretty easy to assemble.  My 10 year old daughter helped me put it together in about 20 minutes.  I got everything tightened up and it\'s pretty sturdy.  It does have a little wobble when my cat goes on the higher platform.  I feel like that\'s to be expected with something this tall being jumped on by a fairly large, adult cat.  He\'s a cautious cat and it doesn\'t seem to bother him.</></>It took about a day before my cat fell in love with this cat tree.  He\'s formerly feral so at first I think he wasn\'t quite sure what it was.  My cat is pretty big.  I think he may be part Norwegian forest cat. He\'s quite long and about 14 lbs now.  He refuses to go in the top cat cave thing or the hammock.  He loves the platforms, scratching posts, and sleeping on the bottom.  The scratching posts are tall enough that he can stretch to scratch. He fits comfortably on the platforms.  He used to meow at me constantly to sit on the ottoman with him on my lap so he could see out the window.  He\'s a lot less whiney now that he has his own seat by the window.  It was worth the money.  I spent a lot of time looking for a cat tree.  I\'m glad that I chose this one.\n
 I have been looking for a tall scratching post for my 2 cats. I read the positive reviews about this one and decided to give it a try. It does not disappoint! It easily assembles in less than 5 minutes and is sturdy as can be. It really is pretty tall although I would purchase an even taller model if I could find one! It has a large sturdy base and is very well made. My cats love to scratch and climb a the way to the top. I\'ve found that it sheds some "particles" after a week or so of use but it\'s minimal not an issue. I vacuum the base and it\'s good to go. Would def purchase again!\n
 My cat enjoys this and so does my sister\'s!  He can actually reach up to his full height and scratch, not like the other posts on my cat tree where he can be lazy and scratch while sitting.  He\'s only 9 lbs, so not, in my perspective, a big cat.  I like that it\'s very easy to put up and take down.  There are only like seven pieces, the bottom, the two parts of scratching post, a middle partition, and the screws and stuff to put it together.  Very simple!</></>The first time I ought this home (I\'m a college kid) my sister\'s cat and mine were climbing on it.  They were racing each other to the top!  They were reenacting that fateful scene where Scar throws Mufasa from the cliff to his doom!  So not only is this a good scratching post, it\'s a good climbing post too.  Sometimes one of them just sits on top.</></>I would definitely recommend this.  This is great and is sturdy.  I don\'t have to weigh the bottom down either, and it doesn\'t shake much/at all when they jump and play on it!\n
 This is hands down the best cat scratching post I\'ve ever purchased, and I\'ve tried quite a few. Descriptions and reviews always tell you how sturdy they are, and yet my cat, who weighs 13 lbs., would easily knock them all over. I\'ve even had to fill the (hollow) posts with rocks to keep them standing. This post is very easy to assemble. The base is sturdy and reliable, and the post itself is 6" in diameter. My cat can actually sit on top of it, which he loves doing. It\'s by far the sturdiest and heaviest post I\'ve ever purchased. I didn\'t have to do a thing to it except assemble it. No rocks needed. No matter how fast he comes at it or jumps on it, it stays put. I highly recommend this post. My cat loves it. Plus, it\'s tall. He is able to get a full stretch while scratching, which is what cats need. I\'m actually going to order a second one since we both love this one so much. Highly recommended!!\n
 I\'ve been looking for a scratching post like this my whole life except I had no idea such a one actually existed!</>When I got home tonight my husband had already put it(Them, actually, because I bought two) together. He said it was easy and they seemed to be as stable as I had said they should be according to comments. When I looked at them I was both shocked and delighted because they were bigger than I ever anticipated. My husband asked me if I was planning on adopting a Bobcat! &#129315;</>But, the cats are already scratching and playing on them. Hopefully, between these awesome, cat approved, scratching posts and the \'sticky paws\' double sided tape panels I\'ve put on the sofa, cupboards and walls, we can get the cats to leave the furniture and cupboards alone so we can do some remodeling!</>These really are awesome and seem as if they will remain sturdy. I would say these are WELL worth the money!!!</>And these days there are not many things you\'ll hear me rave about like these.\n
 Got big cats?  Then this is the scratching post for you!  For those who aren\'t handy or can\'t be bothered to get handy, this scratcher is the total bomb for Maine Coons, Weegies and any \'ol gigantic cat.  It\'s so totally awesome that we\'re glad we ordered 2 for our giant Weegies.  We\'re thinking that we\'ll order a couple more because the great stuff for big cats tends to vanish just when it\'s time to re-stock.</></>Assembly is simple and fast.  Everything needed to screw the pieces together is included - 1 allen wrench, 1 washer, 1 bolt and 1 connecting bolt.  It took less than 3 minutes to put it together.  Really.  Our smallest scruffy cat is already swinging from the heights!</></>It really is 41" tall and 6" in diameter.  The base is heavy, 19" square and supports the height correctly.  Because the big cats stand on the base to scratch, it won\'t fall over.</></>All in all, we have a winner!  Thank you Midwest Homes for remembering the big guys.</></>Update:  These are the favorite scratching posts in the house.  Even our scruffy mini cat (13 lbs) tears it up on this scratcher.  He climbs to the top and then launches himself on the table or into space.  Our gigantic Weegies can stretch full length for the first time ever while scratching.  The 1/4" sisal looks as if it will last for a while even with the heavy use.  So, we ordered 2 more as back-ups.\n
 I\'ve had the first post at least since 2016, maybe even earlier, &amp; it has held up very well though many cats, including my 2018 yellow-kitty rescue, a mama &amp; litter of kittens I rescued &amp; fostered in 2020 -- the white (initially-feral-now-my-baby) mama of the litter I rescued still climbs up &amp; perches on top!  As per the photos, the top portion was getting shaggy. I was finding large clumps of sisal around it each day, &amp; feared they might ingest it.</>As my kitties scratched on the bottom section, the top was pretty much unused -- so, I simply removed the bottom section to throw away, then used the top section to become the now-shorter post!  As you can see, one of my kitties used it even before I could move it into the other room, where it\'ll now stay!</>This post is so sturdy -- no complaints from me or my kitties!\n
 I avoided buying a scratching post from a pet store as they were too short and didn\'t seem sturdy enough. This post is just short of 4\' high, about 4" in diameter and attached to a base that prevents tipping even when the kitty gets aggressive. It\'s sturdy enough and doesn\'t take up as much space compared to other options out there.</></>So far, it\'s a great deal for about $40 compared to what was available in the stores. If it doesn\'t stand the test of time - or kitty\'s claws - I will update my review.\n
 Took me 20 minutes to assemble but I was deliberate and cautious and could probably put together in 10 minutes.  Box was about 47 pounds and the package was well arranged and secure.  There were no missing pieces or damaged items.  I was able to securely tighten all columns without threat of stripping threads.  No need for screwdriver or tools although they recommend flathead.  This is made in China which does not bother me the slightest because it is so well made.  I think the rope could be better quality but that is it.  I love this so much I may buy these little squirts another one.\n
 My cat did not like this at first until I took it apart. I used the bed somewhere else and removed the post holding it up. Also removed the hammock which she had no use for. Now she loves to sit on it and look out the window.</>A big NO NO NO to putting carpeting on the sisal rope sections. Carpet pieces get stuck in her claws almost daily when she scratches on them and I have concern she could swallow the pieces if I don\'t yank them out of her claws first (challenging to say the least).</>While this is pleasing to look at for the cat owner, the carpet on the sisal sections (which I am assuming is not digestible and has chemicals) is a BAD IDEA. Is it there for looks or because it\'s cheaper than sisal rope?</>Pet product companies need think of the safety of the cats that are using their products..\n
 We moved to a new house and catten was starting to claw the furniture (something he\'s never done). It took a sec to realize he didn\'t have his trusted cat tree in the living room. Since one was in his room and the other in the loft, we needed a scratcher. I was hesitant to get another tree, especially since the sisal is so thin he takes it out in a couple of months.</></>But this scratcher has nice thick rope. It has taken to his scratching well. Catten diverted his attention immediately when this was put in the living room, saving our less than year old La-Z-Boy chairs. It\'s sturdy enough to handle his weight, though he doesn\'t jump to the top, just stands and scratches as high as he can reach.\n
 I ordered the cat tower in Black and I am very happy with it. It is not your typical cardboard and pressed board construction. I did not think I would describe a cat tower as pretty, but it is. It looks like a piece of furniture. Do not be put off by the small footprint, it\'s sturdy construction allows for this. My cat jumps on and off it with abandon and it barely moves at all. It is hard to find a dark tower for a black cat. This has soft fur and a pretty black and white print. I think it will hold up much longer than my prior towers.  It is easily assembled but follow instructions carefully as some of the hardware can be inserted in wrong spots if not careful. My cat loves the curl-up spot on top and the height, it is about 50" tall. If the style works for your cat, have no doubt about it, I think you\'ll love it as much as Poe an I do.\n
 We recently adopted 3 litter-mate kittens from a rescue shelter.  They love the tower, and our furniture loves the fact that the tower has all those scratching posts.  Often multiple kittens are playing or sleeping on the tower at the same time.  It is very easy to put together (just need to use the provided allen wrench on a few bolts), and has good instructions.  It took me about 15 minutes on my own to put it together.</></>The kittens don\'t play with the balls on strings very much, but that they may be because they have plenty of toys.  When they jump on the top seat, that particular pole wiggles a bit, but the kittens don\'t mind at all.  They jump up there without hesitation, and even though the seat doesn\'t look that big, there are often two cats on the top seat.  Sometimes, they even play/fight with each other both on the top seat, and with one on the top seat, and one on the section below.</></>All-in-all, the kittens give it 3 paws up!!\n
 &#160;We have two bengals, and needed an alternate climbing option beyond their cat tree.  We wanted something tall and sturdy and this is one of the best affordable, non-custom options available.  We actually have two of these &#8212; one at our home and one at the in-law&# ;s for when the cats travel there with us.</>When we bought the second one, we realized something taller (more challenging) would be even better, but it doesn&# ;t seem to exist on the market.  As an experiment, we took one of the &#8220;pole&#8221; lengths from another unit and added it (so that there are 3 rather than 2 lengths of pole).  This modification seems to work well &#8212; our cats enjoy the extra height (as you can see from the photo).  Either way &#8212; if you use it as-is or modify it to be one length taller &#8212; it&# ;s a good scratcher option.  The only reason we&# ;re not giving 5 stars is that we wish they: (1) offered other color options for the furry faic and (2) offered an extension piece to make it taller (so you don&# ;t have to pull from another unit).\n
 My cat Bugsy had totally shredded the faic on a La-Z-Boy recliner. I replaced it with a leather one that both rocks and swivels -- cats don\'t usually like the feel of smooth leather or objects that move when they scratch. Instead I got this HUGE 41", 6" diameter cat scratcher that looks like a mini-cannon -- and he LOVES it! He doesn\'t even scratch the one other chair he used to bother anymore!</></>The best part of all this is -- I no longer am screaming at my wonderful Bugsy which I did every time I heard his nails ripping on the chair and our house is now peaceful and loving. The pictures show Bugsy sitting on the base of the scratcher (which I also treat with catnip/catnip spray) and the poor chair I had to throw out.\n
 Three cats have given this condo a try: an 8 month old, 1.5 year old. and an 18 year old. The older cats did not like using the lowest level as a step up, because the wicker sides are higher than the thin pillow inside. I padded this and the top level basket with towels to fix this issue, but only the kitten approved. She takes a running start at the cat tree and shoots up to the top level like a maniac and the structure stays stable. She only weighs 5 pounds, but she gets up a head of steam.</>The senior cat thought the platforms were not padded enough and wasn\'t comfortable getting from level to level, but she was pretty sick when she used this condo. The 1.5 yo cat doesn\'t really like cat condos at all, but she did enjoy the wicker igloo. The kitten immediately loosened the plastic screw cover on the penultimate level and I took it from her before she swallowed it. She likes to pull herself around on the ground using the 4 pillars. The rattan and sissal parts of the cat condo still look good, but I\'ve only had the kitten for a week and I\'m sure they will be shredded soon. Better that than my furniture.\n
 I have a 16-pound cat who doesn&# ;t really understand how strong and big he is. So he tends to eak a lot of his toys and cat furniture. I&# ;ve tried other &#8220;jumbo&#8221; or &#8220;huge&#8221; cat scratching posts and they only last for a few months. He&# ;s also pretty tall so when he stretched out to scratch, he would tip over the other scratching posts. When this one arrived, I was slightly overwhelmed by how massive it was. You should be warned that it&# ;s huge so it definitely stands out in a room. Important thing though is that my big cat LOVES it. The first time he used the scratching post, he kept scratching for a good 5 minutes and he was finally able to stretch his entire body.</></>Only downside, this post smells really bad. I&# ;d say it has this awful dirty socks kind of smell to it. I&# ;ve had it for a few weeks now but the smell hasn&# ;t completely aired out. If I walk past it and get a whiff, I get self conscious for no reason.\n
 &#160;I have purchased many cat towers and scratching posts in my time and this is by far one of the best. My sister got my Mom a kitten for her birthday and we convinced her not to declaw. She didn&# ;t want to get a cat tree, so I went on a hunt to find a stand-alone scratcher. My requirements were that it should be tall enough for an adult-sized cat to stretch out fully when using it, that it have sisal (and enough of it for the cat to scale the whole post), and that it be solid and sturdy so it would remain upright. This scratching post exceeded my expectations and it was super easy to assemble. And for what you get, the price is very reasonable. I liked it so much that I am going to order another for my 2 adult cats!\n
 With 3 kittens and 2 cats, scratching posts get moved around and even shredded at times. This post is taller than most of the posts in my house and much thicker around then any of the posts in my house. The kittens will stop halfway up and realize they can use their back claws as well as front to climb the post and will sit there for a few minutes using all four claws until they start playing king of the hill and trying to knock each other off and gain the top of the post. When the kittens are done, the adults stretch to fully extend themselves as they scratch the post. Sometimes they will act like they are climbing a tree as they move up the post. So far only 3 have been on it at one time, but it has held them without any swaying and they weigh from 7 pounds to 12 pounds each.\n
 This is one big scratcher!  I wouldn\'t call it indistructable, but it\'s probably indistructable to a house cat.  Exceeds the quality expectation, especially for the price.  Lot\'s of value for a quality product here, very sturdy for a cat\'s weight.  Kuzya scratches it like a tiger then perches on the top to watch over his domain!\n
 I bought this for my rather large Maine coon because he was scratching the rug, furniture--anything he could get his claws on.  I prefer a carpeted base to one with hard wood.  When I put this up, he loved it immediately and he has stopped scratching everything else which is amazing.  This post is VERY big and tall (and heavy) but what I like is that it has a carpeted base and is extremely sturdy--it will not tip over no matter how much the cat pulls on it (he weighs 15 lbs and is very strong).  The cat will climb to the top when I tempt him with a toy so it\'s good exercise.  He also uses it to stretch.  The sisal is one of the best materials--cats really like it.  Only time will tell how long it lasts.  It was easy to assemble.  I\'ve had many scratching posts through the years and so far, this one checks all the boxes.\n
 This is a great product and totally worth the buy. Small scratching posts are always either really flimsy and easily destroyed by cats or they&# ;re really expensive. This post is huge and sturdy and it&# ;s massive. It&# ;s like a tree. Well worth the cost compared to any other scratching post. Great if you have large cats. My cats both love it and the smaller cat actually jumps up and climbs on it and hangs off the side with her claws. The big cat is really tall and he will stand up on his back feet and stretch his front legs all the way up as high as he can reach when he scratches it. This is a cat who will stand up on his back legs to grab things off the kitchen counter with his paws instead of jumping up onto the counter if that gives you an idea how tall he is. So glad I bought this.\n
 I love the length and circumference of this cat post. It&# ;s extra tall and the cats really love stretching out when they scratch on the post. All four cats use it throughout the day. I purchased this so I could deter one of my cats started scratching on the door frames! Although Pearl hasn&# ;t stop scratching the door frames completely, this post helps her scratch less! The cats make scratching on the post a game. It&# ;s very cute watching them, and it make me feel like it was money worth spending! I definitely recommend this super big cat scratching post! Great investment on my part!\n
 As those of us who shop on Amazon frequently know, there is a significant savings in buying open boxed or gently used products. So when I saw this cat tree for 50% off, I decided to chance it. Well the reason people returned the product was that they had been sent the wrong hardware LOL so I cannibalized an old cat tree and was able to put it together.</></>All I can say is it\'s really cute and seems to be quite stable as it has a weighted base. I\'m getting a litter of kittens to Foster so I needed something that they could crawl all over and hopefully they\'ll like it.</></>Had the correct hardware been included, it would have taken 2 minutes to put together &amp; received five stars.\n
 I knew this scratcher would be big, but I didn&# ;t realize just HOW big until it was out of the box and set up! Not only is it tall, but it&# ;s a large tube too, and an extremely sturdy base! My 12 pound gals have jumped up on it and climbed to the top and there was no worry about it falling over! The words I keep using to describe the scratcher are &#8220;sturdy&#8221; and &#8220;hefty&#8221;.</></>I thought the cat in the advertised picture was just another badly scaled photoshop job, but honestly it&# ;s not far off! I&# ;m including a photo comparing the size of this scratcher to another popular (and also sturdy!) scratcher. Both scratchers are great and the cats are happily using both, but if you have a long or big kitty, you might want to consider this scratcher so they can stretch to their full length!</></>Last note, it&# ;s very easy to assemble.\n
 Can\'t say enough good things about this cat tree!!  It\'s sturdy, easy to assemble and made of better quality materials than anything we had had before or seen.  Our 5 cats love it:  the multiple levels are well designed for play; they especially like the 4th level that has a "hole" and allows them to play paw at each other.  The top perch is well used by our height-seeking cats.  The cubby is snuggly for naps.  We have had numerous guests comment on how nice the unit is with great looking upholstery that enhances our rooms.  We liked this so much we also orderd 3 other models in the same pattern/design: The Salvador, The Escapade, and most recently, The Carnival.  Each is well liked by our cats and kittens and look great in the rooms they are in!\n
 Just set this up, so if anything changes I&# ;ll update the review. But my cats LOVE this thing!</></>Pros: Our 2 cats are obsessed!!  very sturdy, nice thick material and padding- seems very plush, I was actually really surprised with how nice the material is. You can reattach the little puff balls or add other items on, unlike some items once they pull the toy off you can&# ;t tie it back on. Great price and pretty great quality (time will tell how well it holds up! But it seems like it will for a long time). No plastic waste! Everything wasn&# ;t wrapped and tied in a bunch of waste</></>Neutral/Cons: the instructions could have been a little more helpful but overall not super complicated, it came in a cardboard box with all the individual pieces just placed in the box, so on arrival the box was partially ripped open and I was worried some of the smaller parts could have fallen out, luckily they were all there. But maybe in the future the company could attach the screws/bolts to one of the larger items. Also the 3rd tier didn&# ;t have the hole cut out of the faic so we had to cut it ourselves\n
 This is the largest cat scratching post I have ever seen. If you looking for a sturdy post your cat will love this is the one.  Our Eddie is on the smaller side at 9 lbs but he really enjoys a full stretch that those short posts can&# ;t provide. Cats need and enjoy a post that allows them to reach and extend their body. This post has a one piece base that bolts to the base of the post and is not going to fall over. Well made and heavy duty and should last for years. Be prepared this post is massive but is made like furniture and looks great. It&# ;s pricey but if it saves your sofa from destruction, it&# ;s a bargain!\n
 We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this item. The designs on the faic are ocade and it looks high-quality and unique. We searched stores prior to taking the risk of buying online, and this is far more beautiful than anything we saw at the pet stores.</>2 concerns: The plastic covers meant to cover the bolts on the horizontal pieces (where the cat sits) do not fit and slide off with even the slightest movement. Therefore, the bolts in the middle of two tiers will be exposed to the cat. No problems with this safety-wise that I can find however.</>Secondly, for large cats the topmost tier might be too small. I think this will fit most adult cats, but not a cat like a Maine Coon- just something to be aware of if your cat is particularly large.\n
 I knew this was going to be a large cat scratching post, but I never expected it to be as big as it is&#8212; it is HUGE! &#128563;(You can see how tiny my &#8220;plump&#8221; 13.5 pound kitty looks laying next to it.) It is extremely well made, sturdy, and durable, and the sisal scratching post is super thick. It really is something! This scratching post would be ideal for multi-cat households, for sure. I&# ;ve always just ordered regular scratching posts before and they&# ;ve always had to be replaced after a while, so I decided to spend a little bit more for better quality, and I&# ;m glad I did, because I don&# ;t foresee having to replace this one for YEARS! Of course, only time will tell, though. I have two 9-year old cats, and at first, I don&# ;t think they quite knew what to make of it, but they eventually figured it out. The carpet on the bottom is super soft, and my one kitty loves laying on it. As long as you don&# ;t mind a very tall and large scratching post, I definitely recommend this one, for sure. &#128077;\n
 I bought this for a large cat who has big claws that grow quickly and won\'t let me clip them. His other scratching post was hidden among moving boxes and his claws grew really big to the point that he\'d snag things unintentionally and couldn\'t release his claw unless I helped him unsnag them.</></>Most scratching posts with a single post are too short for my cat to stretch out. The tallest ones I could find before this are ~32 inches. He would stand on his hind legs and placed his front paws on the top part, but his head was even with the top and his front paws were near his head. I thought this one would work better.</></>I frequently bought used scratching posts, usually carpeted or sisal and he recognized the scent and took to them right away. So far, he hasn\'t really recognized it as a scratching post. I rubbed some old catnip on the base and post and he rolled around on the base. He didn\'t like me placing his paws on it. The base is HEAVY and I don\'t worry about him tipping it over. One time he did try it and got his paws stuck in the faic middle part. I\'m planning on turning it on it\'s side so that my cat with smaller nails who is a dedicated horizontal scratcher can get his scent on it. Then turn it back upright.\n
 I have a big kitty and a small kitty, and I wanted a post they both could safely enjoy. The small kitty is the size of an older kitten, but he\'s a few years old, and he\'s very rambunctious, so I needed something that won\'t tip over and crush him. The big kitty is nearly as tall as the post when he scratches. The little one is so small that he can climb to the top lie down on it. They both seem to love the post so much and have stopped scratching the furniture. The post is big, but it\'s not as insanely huge as other reviewers make it out to be. In my mind, it\'s just right.\n
 Over the years I&# ;ve spent money on a number of different larger scratch posts for my cats&#8230;.and they sat for months untouched until I donated them. I tried carpet, sisal mat, bare wood, etc. The last sisal post I bought was tall enough, but the flat disc that attached the top and bottom posts prevented the cats from being able to stretch up and take advantage of the height (the whole reason I&# ;d bought them). This post is different because that flat disc in the middle of the top and bottom portions is pretty much flush with the cylinders. And the post itself is about 6&#8221; wide in diameter! I just adopted a feral cat who is learning how to live indoors. She actually jumps on this post and scales her way to the top. She loves it, and its never come close to falling over. Don&# ;t hesitate to buy this one. I waited until I had it for a few weeks to see if it would be one more that collected dust in the corner, but I&# ;m happy to report it is NOT!\n
 My 15-pound Turkish Van cat LOVES his new post, and I do too!  I like that it uses sisal rope, which he likes to stick his claws in many times every day.  Note that the post is very tall so he can really stretch out.  Two things I don\'t like so much:  1.  The colors.  I would have preferred a more stylish natural ownish color for the sisal and a lighter off white or light grey color for the bottom pad.  2.  The fact that it doesn\'t have a landing pad at the top (as his previous one did).  He still jumps up and sits atop it like a lion in a circus act, but it is more difficult for him to relax there.\n
 Pros: easy to assemble, very soft material and extra cushy padding. My cat (13 lbs calico) especially loves sleeping in the bottom cube part. The faic has a nice floral print which makes it look a little fancier. The hole cut out on the third level is a lot of fun for my cat for stick her head through and hang out of. Theres also plenty of room to climb/stretch out and scratch.</></>Cons: it is pretty wobbly. It took my cat at least a day to get used to it, and I really had to encourage her with treats and straight up putting her on it until she realized it was safe. But it hasn\'t fallen over, and seems sturdy enough to handle a little wobble without eaking, so it\'s not a major con. Plus my cat really loves it now.</></>Overall I would recommend this cat tower.\n
 This scratching post is huge compared to all other posts on the market, although it doesn&# ;t take up as much floor space as you would think in comparison to those pitiful scratching posts you buy that your cat grows out of by the time they are four months old.  My 11 pound athletic cat will run from across the room and stick to it. She is able to climb it like a tree and she can even perch herself on the very top of it and scratch it upside down.  I can honestly say this cat post is my cats favorite toy.  She has never once scratched any furniture or walls with this post around.  I really do believe that it was the absolute best purchase I have made for her and believe me, I have made a LOT of purchases.\n
 The last time I bought a scratching post, it was so tiny I threw it out. This one is much larger than I expected -- big enough for a bobcat or a lynx -- and sturdy. The base alone weights 10 lbs. and is 19" square. It will not tilt over when your cat uses the post. The post itself is 39" tall, 40+" if you include the base, which is an inch and a half thick. The post itself is 5-1/2" in diameter. My photo compares it to the one it\'s replacing (not the tiny one I tossed). It\'s a bit of overkill, but I\'m content with that. It seems very high quality, with velvet covering the base and ornamenting the posts. Wow!\n
 I have scoured the Internet for the most reasonably priced cat post and I ended up here to the exact same one that my wife and I bought years ago. This is our second time purchasing this exact one the last one lasted longer than I expected considering how destructive our cats are. It&# ;s so easy to put together that I didn&# ;t even look at the instructions and it&# ;s very stable everything is tight nothing wobbles and nothing is loose and unlike posts that I have gotten in the past the top of this one is perfectly wide for my cats to perch on top and watch everyone go by. We have bought this before and bought it again and when this one goes bad I&# ;ll be looking for this exact same one to get it again.\n
 Finally an affordable cat post that\'s tall enough for my 12-15 pound cats. It\'s about 3 weeks in and they\'re still figuring out that they can fully stretch out when they sharpen their claws. Just wish that the top had a little more surface area for them to sit on because they\'re always teetering back and forth and don\'t spend nearly as much time sitting on the top as they did on their old post. Also the sisal rope wraps around horizontally which means it\'ll inevitably come undone in the next year or so with how the cats pull on it. Their old post had sisal running up and down the post so there was no chance of it coming unglued from the post.\n
 This thing is SO PRETTY! The picture doesn\'t do it justice. The flower pattern is very attractive. I mainly bought it because the price was right and it fits my space. I had a foster kitten with panleukopenia (distemper), so my other scratcher was contaminated (safe for my vaccinated cats, but not for unvaccinated fosters), so I had to get rid of it. One of my cats really loves the little cubby (the other one had similar cubby that I wanted to get rid of, but she was so attached to it so I ended up having to relocate it after buying this one). It\'s surprisingly sturdy considering it\'s not held up by any posts, but rather a flat base. All my cats like it and I love how pretty it is :)\n
 Easy, easy, easy to put together.  Super sturdy, so if it isn\'t for you, try twisting a little harder.  My cats bound around this thing like crazy.  My picky kitten even sleeps on it already.  Really amazing for the price too, I mean what can you get like this at PetSmart?  Not one damn thing that\'s what.  The soft faic appeals to them and to me because it\'s not like carpet.  Why do I want to encourage my kittens to scratch carpet?  Well I don\'t and I don\'t know why anyone else would either.  Either way, it\'s great, totally worth the money.  We added some strings and jingle balls from the sides so it\'s a full gym for them.  We purchased one of those plastic rod connecting things, well it was alright but we spent a pretty penny for two pieces and it was small.  This is much better!  Wonderful product!\n
 It was easy to put together. We have mommy kitty (Kitty Kitty). That name kitty kitty is her name because she was a stray and we had no intention of keeping her, Yeah Right !!!  She seemed very young and malnourished. Needless to say she got very fat very fast. A miracle you say . WRONG !!! Kitty kitty had five little kitties on our bed a couple of months later . Wonderful !!! Not hardly !!! We managed to give three away. Being the na&#239;ve dumb heads we are, we named them all and became attached to them during the suckling period. So when Morris, Dopey and Reishi left to their new homes we were very sad. Don\'t try this at home. We kept Kitty Kitty, L. C. (Little Cow, black and white like those cows) and Dora (Dora because she was the first to venture out of the birthing area hence Dora the Explorer). They all run through the house like crazed monkeys on steroids. Happy days are here again, NOT. All the leather furniture in the house is covered in raised bumps where they decided to kneed on them. It looks like some drunk blind guy decided to write the Declaration of Independence in ail all over everything . We once had a nice home . Its a love hate thing. Damn, where\'s a sack and some rocks when you need them?  Unfortunately we feel madly in love with the beasts.</>This cat condo has helped to a large degree. Mommy cat uses the rope covered slide for a scratching post all the time and the evil twins, L.C. and Dora scramble all over this condo like two pissed off squirrels and they love to lounge in the two comfy beds. It has helped with the ail problem. I can\'t tell you about how long it might hold up. It seems to be made ok and it will depend on the use by your wildlife . It does shed a great deal. We are pleased with it and I don\'t see this changing any time soon. I can\'t say too much right now they are watching me. They are always watching me. Send Help. Just Kidding, shhhhhh. We are destined to live in a Cat house and I am sure they are the proud owners of us.\n
 It\'s a fairly big cat tree with lots of cool features if you get your cat to use/play with all of them. My cat is about 1.5 - 2 years and at first he wasn\'t interested in the tree at all. Probably because it was still smelling of the glue and wood from the packaging. We ended up modifying the tree a little, i.e. we took some of the items off and only put a few on. I also sprinkled some catnip on everything so he gets interested and checks it out. My cat loves to sit on the window sill so I moved the tree right in front of it, so he can lay on the platform and on the kitty bed. He doesn\'t play with the balls too much since he\'s already about 2 years and my cat is also not using the scratching thing (the s shaped thing). He has a scratching post that I got him when he was a kitten and he\'s still using it even though it\'s totally raggedy.</>All in all I think it\'s a great tree and I\'m sure every kitten will have a blast on it. The tree is covered in plush fur which is really soft and the posts are wrapped in sisal so they can scratch on it. I find it to be very sturdy. My cat is about 12-14 pounds and he jumps on it without it tipping over, even when he jumps on the kitty bed. It moves but it\'s not falling over or tipping so much it\'s about to fall over. The 3 sticks with the ball are somewhat flexible and bendable but you can\'t pull them all the way down, or they\'ll eak. Happened to one of mine when my kitty jumped on it. The sisal around the stick still kind of holds it in place though.\n
 Update at 6 months:</>I heard a loud crash the other night and the next day the lower perch had snapped off and flipped over.  Thankfully my cats are allright.</>The heaviest cat is under 11 lbs and they don\'t sleep together in the same perch, they\'re still learning to get along.</>The plastic base is still attached, the hollow post is upside down on the floor, and a nail ad is sticking into the hollow.  So the plastic end is simply nailed into the cardboard post.</>This is really poor quality to only last 6 months and come crashing down.  I would not recommend this and or this model.</></>Update to original review:</>I had given this 5 stars when I first assembled it.  Within 2 days my cat had ripped the furry parts of the top 2 scratching posts, then stopped using them.  A month later, both top posts are very wobbly.  Yes, I had carefully tightened everything using the supplied tools and strength.  But this item is not built as well as a previously purchased cat condo.  I don\'t think it will last the summer and was not worth the cost.</></>My recommendation would be to try something from Armarkat rather than Go Pet Club, as they seem more solid for long-term use, in my (somewhat limited) experience.  Pay attention to bad reviews as these are not really returnable, I didn\'t keep the original packaging and it would likely cost more to return than it cost to begin with.</></>Original review was glowing but was more of a first impression:</>So far, so great!  My cat couldn\'t wait for me to finish assembling, he was checking it out during the process.  He\'s about 15 pounds and has no trouble getting in and out of the cubby or using the perches.  This model is sturdy compared to a smaller one I have, it has a wider base and doesn\'t tip.</>I expect to get my money\'s worth from this model.  If the sisal starts to come apart I\'ll get out the hot glue gun and fix it, or even buy a roll of sisal and replace it.  I hope kitty begins using the scratching "wave" instead of my carpeting.  (You can lead a cat to a scratching board but you can\'t make him use it.)</>Should there be any design flaws that appear, I will update my review.  But so far this seems like a good sturdy model at a great price.</>The box weighs about 40 pounds and is bulky, so I had someone place it near where I built it. But I had no trouble assembling it myself.\n
 We\'ve only had this less than a day, but it\'s been a hit with one of our two cats so far.  We adopted Jackson, a (now) seven month-old kitten, in late December to be a companion to CK, our nearly eight year-old cat, who lost his 18 year-old companion, Maestro, in mid-December.  Jackson is a typical kitten - he is a ball of fur and love who just wants to play - and CK is a big boy (18 lbs) who will play a little bit but then loses his patience and wants to be left alone, leading to hissing and occasional loud screeching.  We wanted to give CK options to escape Jackson, and to give Jackson other ways to play.  Jackson was all over this cat condo as soon as it was assembled (and assembly was easy).  CK is wary of climbing, though... he has shown interest in the tree and lays down next to the s-shaped scratcher, but he hasn\'t gotten on the tree with his own steam. We have placed him on the platform next to the cubby, and he stuck his head in the cubby, but did not try to go inside.  Jackson is having a ball, and has explored all areas and has been playing with the three balls; I will be hyper-vigilant in trimming his claws, though, because it seems like it would be easy for him to get hung-up and injured, possibly severely.</></>I was ridiculously excited to receive this cat condo, and I am hopeful that CK will start using it, too - especially since it could offer him some peace from Jackson.  It is pretty sturdy, but we\'ll add some weights to the base for added peace of mind.  It was easy to assemble, and the color works well (a bonus, as the color wasn\'t really even a consideration).  I like it very much; I just wish that the cubby had a larger entrance so my CK could (would?) use it. I would have given this item five stars but for the fact that I\'m writing this less than 24 hours from receiving/assembling it... we\'ll see how it stands the test of time.\n
 Pro:</>My two kittens love it.  So much that they\'ve torn apart two of the play balls.  Maybe that\'s normal and expected.  So far everything else has mostly held together.  Ships together in one box, with Tetris-like precision of everything fitting inside itself.  Assembly wasn\'t /that/ difficult, but I can see your average consumer having some difficulty -- the directions are not that great.  I half expected the carpeting to have all kinds of smells and outgassing, but it didn\'t.  The cats claw this thing relentlessly, which makes me glad I got it early (when they were only about 5 weeks old).</></>I wanted to give this 4 stars, but I couldn\'t, and here\'s why:</></>Con:</>The highest platform actually wasn\'t fully put together inside the carpeting, so I had to take a razor blade to the outside edge to get back into the inside and re-seat the grommet that the pole screws into, and then glue all the carpeting back.  Time will tell if hot glue was enough to hold it, but so far it\'s more stable than before.  But I shouldn\'t have had to do that.  It was just VERY poor quality build on the manufacturer\'s part, and as heavy as this was (and having read other people\'s failed attempts to work with the manufacturer directly on missing parts and the like), I knew returning it wasn\'t worth the hassle.\n
 I have a large, energetic cat who is very hard on the things he enjoys. I didn\'t expect this to last for years but I did hope it would last more than a few months. The thin fur that covers the cat tree had holes and was falling off by the end of the first day. One off the hanging balls fell off by the end of the first month. My cat loves to run and jump on the tree and the perches then enthusiastically jump off. The base is not heavy enough to stabilize the tree so it tips over a lot. Also, the perches are connected with access through plastic. Unfortunately the plastic oke and one of the perches fell off. The sisal rope also disconnected from the favored scratching area.</>Although my tree didn\'t last, if you have a smaller cat I suspect it will last much longer. My can is 16 pounds of muscle and energy. He has extra toes to add to the scratching power. He absolutely loves being on the perches so he can look out the window. I suspect that any cat tree in this price range would not hold up to his use. If you have a smaller cat that is likely to be less destructive this tree would likely last much longer.\n
 I recently got a kitten as my sweet cat passed in August at the age of 19 and I knew it was time to have the companionship I was missing. I ordered the Go Pet Club Cat Condo before I ought the 11 week kitten home and she has enjoyed it so much. I showed her the lower bed as soon as we got home and the next day I found her in the high bed watching traffic go by! I read the reviews and I don\'t know how anyone thinks it is not stable. If it can stand up to the romping of my kitten, it can stand up to anything. She plays rough and she can jump straight up into the air at least 3-4 feet and come down with a THUMP that you think would put a hole in the floor then run at super speed through the house (how those little bones stand it, I don\'t know) and she jumps on and off the condo and it stands up to her and even the balls are still attached to the strings. You just have to make sure you screwed everything in tight!\n
 I\'ll start off by saying it was a day late shipping to me. Not a big deal, but heads up.</></>Anyways, this tree is amazing. We have a kitten and we know we need to make a long term investment in a big tree because she will grow out of the smaller ones real quick. This same tree was $260 at Pet Smart. We found it here and honestly expected it to suck. But we tried it and it turned out fantastic. It\'s super easy to assemble and has good instructions. Took me 10 mins tops to finish, and our kitten was playing on it before I even finished building. She loves it.</></>The perches and cubbie are too big for her obviously, but they look plenty big enough for when she is an adult. She will be comfortable. It\'s really sturdy and the hanging balls are a great add on. She plays with them constantly.</></>Needless to say, we will be purchasing here again. Great product.\n
 We had just rescued a five year old cat, whom they said liked to climb, into a home with two large dogs. We thought she would need a place to get up higher that was preferably not our kitchen counter. I searched online, carefully reading reviews &amp; thought this was a fair price &amp; bet. It turns out THIS WAS PERFECT! It arrived right on time, was in great condition with all parts present, wicked easy to put together (less than 5 min) and of course it came in a box, so all cats &amp; dogs were already interested. It did smell a little like "new" plastic or something, so we put our families dirty clothes on it for a day or two and.....PERFECT! Within a week, all three of our cats climb, scratch, sleep, &amp; play on it. WIN, WIN!</></>The only downside, is that the top two platforms are a little small for our largest cat (12lbs) she lays there anyway, and loves it, but if it were just a hair bigger, I\'d purchase a second one.\n
 Nice looking product - however the two towers screw in by tiny screws and will not fasten down appropriately for a cat or cats(s) jumping up and down off of it. The upper post oke off at the base within two weeks and the other one is quite wobbly and I assume will eak in the near future.</></>This is not intended for cats over 10lbs - as the triangular cubby hole is quite small, as well as the circular \'run through\' hole below that. I bought this on reading several reviews on this being able to hold larger cats - mine are 10bs and 7lbs. This is untrue. Absolute waste of money.</></>These are pictures of the oken higher tower and how flimsy it is constructed, the lower second tower which came misshapen and the overall result. Do not waste your money. Also, one of the attached \'play balls\' came undone about a week after purchase.</></>Unless you place this in a corner, this thing has no chance of standing on its\' own. Bad Porduct! Do not buy this.\n
 I received the package and assembeled the cat tree in about 20 minutes. There are picture instructions that are VERY easy to follow. No tools required. The cat tree is very sturdy if you make sure to tighten the screws all the way. The carpet faic is low in quality but is very soft. If your cat is a heavy scratcher I anticipate that the faic will not last long. My cat is a full grown 8lb cat at 5 years old. The condo space is just the right size for her. If you have a larger cat this is likely not the cat tree for you. What I really like about this cat condo is that the perches have edges and are pillow like. The perches are high enough that my cat can get away from my 70 lb dog ( boxer golden mix) . It is a good condo for the price that I paid. I don\'t anticipate having it last for more than a few years because of the carpet faic but for the price I am satisfied.\n
 Overall this is a really good product. Assembly was very simply and pretty self explanatory even though it did include instructions. I have 2 Maine Coon kittens - one 10lbs and the other 7lbs (both still growing).  For 2 kittens that are really feisty, the base is a little light for larger cats.  Jumping from the top pedestal, the large kitten has managed to tip the unit over a time or 2.  5-stars for a heavier, thicker base.</></>Also, one of the balls included with the unit was pretty much destroyed on the first day.  This was expected, but not really on the first day.</></>I would recommend using Loctite when assembling the condo. After a couple of months, somehow the pedestals managed to get kind of wobbly.  This was quickly remedied by twisting each pedestal to tighten the connecting bolts.\n
 This is a great tower. I have three cats and they all love it.  The bed is quite large, my 17 pound cat loves it, and the two high top perches are very plush. It is by far the most sturdy and stable tower I have ever bought, and I have bought quite a few over the years. The quality is great, it was fairly easy to put together and looks nice in such a neutral color. My rescue cats don\'t have claws, so I can\'t attest to the durability of it in that regard, but I would bet that it would hold up well. Overall this is a great tower, at a great price, and I would recommend this to anyone who has cats.</></> Update:</></> Just rescued an 8 week old kitten and he loves it, especially the toys that dangle down and the round center napping area.  Now all 4 of my cats love it, and it is very sturdy when they start playing on it with each other.\n
 I looked at hundreds for the right one that would fit on my small living room.  and finally I decided on this one and was so nervous but its an amazing new place for the kittens to play thats all theirs and they love it.  I have been telling all my friends about it and posted pictures on Facebook.  I hope my cat loving friends get more of these.  If my living room was a little bigger I\'d orden another one.  I\'m thinking of ordering a similar one only a diferent style for my bedroom.  Pet Club packaged this in perfect box and young neighbor had it together in 15 minutes.  Thank You Pet CLUB LLC . If it had not been for your reasonable prices and shipping I would not have been able to afford to get this.  I love it.\n
 My cat have had this for a year now.  The top two towers are a little rocky (my cats got kinda fat) but I also think I can tighten the bolts again -- I\'m just lazy.  One of the little balls on a string busted off because of me, though.  They never use that little wavy scratch post or climb into that hoop, but maybe a kitten would.  They do use it as a scratching post though, so that\'s perfect.  They do enjoy sitting on the upper levels as they look out the windows.  My youngest cat likes to do that crazy-run-around-the-house-at-3am thing and bolt up and down this tree.  Overall, my cats love having a piece of furniture they know is truly theirs.\n
 We were looking for a scratching post / climbing something for our new kitten who was starting to use our furniture for non-acceptable purposes.  This seemed to be the best bang for the buck when looking the choices.  It was very easy to put together even with the help of the cat. She played with each part as I put it together. Once together it is very sturdy and big.  I am not worried about it tipping over.  The S shaped scratching board does stick out from the base.  I simply turned it to the side so it would not be tripped over. So far she cannot walk past it without jumping on and playing or taking a nap. :)\n
 This is a great cat tower because it\'s tall but not TOO tall, and all of the beds/spaces are perfectly large enough for my sort of large cat. If you\'re looking for something that won\'t take up your entire wall, and that won\'t be too small for your not-tiny cat, this is a great choice. I think I assembled it in about 10 minutes or less, and I don\'t notice and issues with sturdiness. Sure, it isn\'t rock-solid, but it isn\'t a noticeable hazard to either me or my cat. It\'s great. I put an additional cat bed on the bottom platform and she loves hanging out down there when she wants to get extra cozy and protected. I definitely recommend this!\n
 I enjoy this product. It is extremely easy to put together, probably took me 10 minutes, but I\'m a little bit on the handier side. I thought it might have been made out of cardboard because of the price, but it\'s wooden. It definitely is sized for smaller cats - I have a kitten who loves it. Though she still prefers to claw up the couch instead of her new tower. The balls were a nice touch and she love attacking them. She never has gone into the circular perch on the bottom and has no interest. I think it would be better if you had multiple kittens, they might actually use it. The beds are nice and cushioned, I find her sleeping on the beds often - but sometimes she still prefers our chairs or falls asleep where she lies haha. Overall, I think it\'s a great investment.\n
 My cats LOVE this! They sleep/play on this everyday! It is VERY study, which I was concerned about because one of my cats a bit rough when he plays and he is also tall (about 12-13" tall) and long (about 18-19" in length). He has contorted the top bed a little because he is so big and sleeps in it everyday but he has never fallen out of it and seems to still enjoy sleeping in it anyway.</></>My other kitten is considerably smaller and she runs and climbs up the posts and the other cat chases her and they play on the posts a lot and its still study.</></>They don\'t really use the "s" shaped thing or the circular tunnel at the bottom very much, but the rest of it they absolutely love.</></>I would definitely buy this or another kitty condo from this and!\n
 Just got this cat tree today and it is very soft plush and my cat couldn\'t even wait till I got done putting it together to play on it!!</>In regards to ease of putting it together: VERY easy to put together. The directions already to follow pictures showing coordinating screws and comes with Allen wrench. I put this together myself in about 10 mins. My cat loves the play balls attracted to the string on the second level and the "house" next to it.</>Well made and sturdy. Bottom is wide so it won\'t tip over.</>Love the scratch areas on the poles and the "slide".</>And the price point makes it an even better deal!!\n
 I bought this cat tree on Oct 15, 2016 and received it a couple days later, so shipping was convenient. The tree itself is holding up pretty well my cat uses the scratching posts daily and they are in the same condition as when I received it. I can\'t speak on the bed posts because after spending $60 on the tree my cat being a cat chooses to sleep on the couch instead of the tower. Lastly, I\'m giving four stars because the tower is sturdy, however it will lift/shift slightly when my cat\'s using the scratching posts and because the string the balls are on are thin and my cat oke them playing with them (I think that\'s an easy fix though). Overall I believe it\'s a good purchase.\n
 This cat tree is very nice and big,  and our two older kittens love it.  They use it mostly for sleeping in now, but they use it every night.  It is sturdy, well made, and easy to put together. The reason I only gave it three stars is because it smelled horrible and permeated of formaldehyde when we received it.  Formaldehyde is not good for people or cats, and I had hives for two days because I touched it.  I had to put it outside to air out on our patio for a week, and rubbed baking soda into and vacuumed it out.  It was more work than I expected but worth it in the end.\n
 What we paid for this was a good price and our cat has been using the scratching posts and the two top beds, so we are really pleased with the Cat Condo. Our cat, however, doesn\'t seem to be interested in balls of any kind, so she doesn\'t play with the dangling balls. The balls have something in the inside that sounds like beads, so they make a sound, but it doesn\'t attract her attention. She also hasn\'t ever touched the "S" curve scratch pad. Maybe your cat(s) will be different, but the dangling balls and scratch pad are basically pointless to our cat.\n
 The things that stick up with toys dangling off them are a little cheesy the beds are somewhat small and the sides are soft not rigid. I bought this as a housewarming gift for a friend and her cats love it even the larger 15lb cat enjoys sitting in the beds. It\'s a nice size for their apartment and gives the cats a high viewpoint which is nice for the more shy cats. The top tier is within reach (I can pick up a cat from it and I am 5\'7\'\'). It is a little wobbly but not anything worth concern. It was easy to assemble although the box it came in was heavy.\n
 I purchased this for my new kitten, Layla. The assembly was minimal and very easy- all tools required are included. My kitten instantly took to this product- she knows this is an awesome place to hang out, and she does so frequently.</></>Other reviewers have mentioned that it seemed that the tower was unstable on carpet- I use this on carpet and haven\'t noticed any instability.</></>Update (11/16/2016): I have to drop this down to 3 stars. The elevated cat beds oke off under the weight of a 13.5lb cat. The shards were fairly sharp, so I am concerned that other cats may get hurt if the bed eaks while unattended.\n
 Oh my goodness, the kittens love it.  Recently got 2, 9-week old kittens.  Now at 14 weeks this is their sanctuary/penthouse!  Each has established their own level to sleep and the scratching post is one of their favorites.  Before they used it for the first time I sprayed a bit of catnip on it (lightly) to let them know it was theirs.</></>It was fairly easy to assemble; I am "directionally challenged" so my husband read instructions and I assembled.  You won\'t go wrong with this "jungle-gym"!\n
 If I could give ZERO stars I would ! This is a cheaply made item. My 10 lb cat can\'t even fit in any of the beds without hanging over, the poles are so thin that they have now started to rip out from the wood as I\'ve had to tighten them over and over and now today only about a month old the sticks that hold the play balls has oken off. This is not suitable for anything but possibly a gerbil !!! I\'ll gladly send images of the falling apart unit to anyone who wants to see.\n
 Cats love playing on this and it\'s a nice size without being overly large. Only minor downside is that the top \'basket\' is a little wobbly and so my cats aren\'t crazy about sitting in that one unless we put them in it.  The lower basket is used very often though - cats love bird watching from it.\n
 Im giving this 4stars because I dont know how it will hold  up over time.  Mine arrived on time. Was nicely packaged. It was very easy to put together. I  had it together in 10 minutes .  Its very sturdy and the material is very soft and plush. It has a strong chemical odor thats given me a bit of a headache and where ive touched it, im itching. But thats most likely my very sensitive skin.</>Ill update my review in  few months and see how its  stood up to two very playful kitties.</>So far im happy with.\n
 We are very pleased with our purchase of this cat condo.  We bought this to replace another cat tree that was given as a gift and after six months of being happily used by two cats, it had finally fallen into disrepair.  We upgraded to this model and with three cats now, we believe we made a great choice.</></>Pros:</>*Easy to put together.  I believe one person could do it on their own and with two it was a eeze.</>*Overall Durability.  The frame has already taken quite the abuse and is still standing strong.  Every once in a while we need to tighten something, but it is as easy as that.</>*Weight. It is durable, but light enough to move to clean or relocate.</>*Scratch posts are the perfect texture to attract kitties.  We have cloth furniture and carpet in our home, but it seems that with the multitude of scratching posts available on the condo, the cats just leave our good things alone.</>*Price. For our family, the price was very reasonable for what you get.</></>Cons:</>*The hanging toys. I gave them two weeks and I was surprised to find that they are lasting longer than that.  They look pretty rough though and it is only a matter of time before we loose all three balls and spokes.  I knew that this would happened and suppose it is indicative of the cats enjoying themselves.  I just wish they were designed a bit sturdier.</>*The color.  It shows the dirt.  Badly.  I guess it doesn\'t show the cat hair as bad as something darker, but I am constantly trying to keep it look clean.</></>Overall it has been a great purchase and we the time comes to replace it, we will definitely look into another Go Pet Club Condo.\n
 I like the size and ease of assembly of this tree.  I have 6 cats (I know, it is kind of a problem :-) )  and there is always someone in it.  I wish the beds were larger and the sisal was more robust as I have had to restring almost all the posts with new material.\n
 While I like the cat tower overall, I must say that the top level has become wob - I tried unscrewing it and screwing it back in again but that did not fix the problem.  Another thing is the sides of the top 2 levels are soft material, making it hard for a cat to grasp something and climb up...  I like Go Pet Club Towers very much and own another 72" one that is perfect!  Yes, if you have a cat with claws, they will rip the fuzzy carpet off - I just superglue it back on, and VOILA!!..... it\'s all better...\n
 This cat tree is awesome. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. I was very picky in choosing one for my cats because they are expensive and cats are picky! I settled with this one and am glad that I did. My cats are 8 and 13 pounds and both use this without any problems. The top beds hold them easily and aren\'t shaky so my cats don\'t get scared. It\'s also high enough so that they can easily lay all day and look out the window. The scratch posts are awesome and have toned down the scratching of my couch! Some reviews have said that the balls are in a weird spot, but my cats love to play with them. My smaller cat stands on the shelf and bats at them and my larger cat bats them from the floor. I\'ve had this almost a year now and it still is in great shape (could almost still pass it as new) and hasn\'t lost any structural integrity. My cats continue to use daily and haven\'t gotten bored with it. I would highly recommend this product. Great value for the price.\n
 I am giving this 5 stars for the value. I got mine thru Warehouse deal for under $80 shipped.</>It didn\'t have instructions so I pulled up the pic from my order &amp; had it put together in about 30 min.</></> Now, for descripton. It is made of "fur" not carpet. The "cave" has fur just on the bottom &amp; is not padded. This was the first piece my cat claimed. Just curled up into a ball &amp; disappeared.</>Her previous quarters were boxes, that I have FINALLY been allowed to get rid of! Woohoo!</></>Next, the "bird\'s nest" are nicely padded. The outside has a crunchy plastic inside the fur, good for attracting &amp; keeping a cat\'s attention. It did take her a week to get to the first one but once again, balled up comfortably for a cat nap.  She hasn\'t really discovered the scratching surfaces yet but they are sisal &amp; appear sturdy.</></> I bought this for 2 reasons. To replace the boxes &amp; give my cat a gym.</></>She is round. About a kind 15 pounds if you\'re wondering if this can comfortably house a full size cat. She stands &amp; lies on top of the cave to look outside the window</></> As far as the gym part, well, her condo isn\'t in it\'s permanent spot where she will have more room. I\'ll let you know how it works out when I take down the Christmas tree.\n
 I\'ve had this for about a month now.  I bought it for some kittens so granted, they are rather feisty and playful.  The carpeting on this is not good quality.  The post where the three ball toys are is covered in this carpet.  My kittens had it shredded within the first week.  The other upright posts are covered in rope or something that is a lot stronger than that carpet.  It\'s holding up okay.  But, if you buy this, don\'t be surprised to find pieces of carpet all over your floor.  Other then that flaw, I love it and so do the kittens.\n
 I got this for about $80 and am okay with the product for that price. The construction is average, but a few holes felt misaligned or shallow/narrow for the screws. Also. it\'s a bit rocky but overall feels more than sturdy for a few cats to use.</></>Potential buys should be aware that this is designed for medium-sized cats. Larger cats will have a hard time resting comfortably on either pedestal or fitting in the condo (the small hollow tube that hangs beneath the main floor is even too small for medium-sized cats).</></>If you get this for $70-80, it\'s a serviceable, decent option. Any price that\'s much higher than that, I imagine you\'ll be pretty disappointing and can find better products if you\'re willing to pay more than $80.\n
 Rather awkward to assemble, some parts requiring 2 people. The faic isn\'t designed for the abuse it will be subjected to, particularly with multiple cats. A cat tree is not just a place to lay, cats play around it, climb and scratch it too. Howver, instead of the durable carpet you expect to find on a cat tree, this is a very lightweight "carpet" with an almost velour like finish. I doubt this will hold up for very long at all. The beds/perches aren\'t sturdy at all, more like a floppy hat.\n
 I love the products I have bought in the past made by Go Pet Club, and this one is no exception.  I keep coming back because you just can\'t beat the value for the quality.  Easy to assemble (I can do it alone in less than half an hour) and the cats love the variety of perches and surfaces to scratch.  A few have commented on the thinness of the material covering the cat tree.  It is not thick carpet, but it has held up fairly well for my cats.  You may have to invest in a new condo every three years or so, but Go Pet Club products are still a huge value over the competitors.\n
 A little disappointed.  I have the Go Pet Club Cat Tree F49  and I love it, that is why I bought this F66.  The F66 is not as sturdy or built as well as the F49.  The posts that hold up the two napping areas are taller than on the F49 but not wider so they wobble.  My cats are 9 &amp; 10 lbs. The little tube under the platform is too short for an adult cat.  They do love the S shaped scratch area.  The corner box on this model (F66) is plenty big enough for the cats.\n
 It was to big for the room but we did still use it. I will say that it is wobbly and the one downer is the beds are soft sides so our cats do not like it. Be careful if you want hard sides. This is not the bed for you we did find one that had 3 beds and came almost completely&#8203; put together, It had hard sides and my cats love it in our room. Also the middle of this one is big enough for our fat boy he likes to hide in it.\n
 Our cats love the low scratching post-- they don\'t use the S-shaped scratch board at ALL though.  The one loves to sleep up top/high, the other tends to just sleep on the lowest flat level oddly.  Sometimes they go in the little hole to sleep but rarely during the time we are home.  The toy is nice, but the location of the toy is odd and I think the cats dont like having to lay on top of the cave to play with it there.  Good price/function, but the "ergonomics" of it are not great.  But for cost, would prob buy again\n
 Kind of small but the price matches the quality and size. Beds are small but will fit a less than 10 lb cat. Poles are thinner than a more expensive condo, but they still do the job as scratchers. I would say this would be for kitten to teen cat size. My 3 and 7 y/o\'s don\'t play with the ball things but they rub their faces on the top of the sticks. Only a kitten would fit in the round tunnel thing at the bottom. Overall, I like it, but for my big cats I still need something alot bigger and most likely more expensive.\n
 My cats LOVE the scratching posts, but they\'re torn to shreds. I\'ve had it for a year, and my downside would be that getting replacement posts to scratch (since they tore it up) is not something I\'ve been able to do. Once they\'re gone, I\'m either going to have to manually replace the string or buy a whole new cat house for my two kits. With this, my cats do not use the middle whole or the top beds. The one loves to climb, but he refuses because they\'re flimsy. Good for a kitten, not a fully grown cat.\n
 My cats love this thing. Putting it together was a little bit of a challenge. It\'s not too sturdy and one of the beds oke off, the stick toys are about to also but my cats are very rough on it and like to wrestle on the top beds and jump on the stick toys so I dont fully blame the makers of the house for the oken pieces. One of my cats only has 1 front leg and this house isnt too tall or very hard for him to jump/climb on so I recommend this to disabled cat owners\n
 I looked forward to getting this for my cat. I have purchased one from this company before and was pleased with it. But she tore the scratchers up so much, it was time for a new one. I like the color and size. I did not have trouble with assembling and everything I needed was in the box. Nothing oke while putting together and it\'s sturdy. My issue was shipping. It said I\'d get it Friday. I didn\'t get it until Tuesday the following week.\n
 The top pedestal posts are a bit wobbly (even with constant tightening) and could be more secure.  The three hanging balls did not last a week - the strings came off of the plastic ball and subsequently on two the whole ball and rope came off - and it\'s 4 month old 3 pound or less kitten going to town on them.  In addition, where the toy poles attach to the post, there are sharp pieces of metal that stick out that need to be snipped or pounded over.  I was leery about the material used to cover the \'\'tree\' but thus far it has been easy to clean and hasn\'t worn.  It\'s been a good deal so far.\n
 High quality product which would cost $200 or more at a Pet Shop. My cat wouldn\'t go near it for the first few weeks until someone suggested that I place cat treats on the different levels.  I did so and when I came home that evening the treats were gone. From that day on he uses it all the time. I have it in a corner by a window and he loves to sit on it and look out the window. He also uses it as an escape when he is tired of my dogs. Lol\n
 I have 2 male cats that are not dainty in any way. They are both about 10-13 pounds and roughhouse together a lot. This is not the condo for them by any means.  We put it together, it was fast and easy.  They can\'t get on top because they are too large, and almost too large to fit in the whole. The round perches are smaller than I thought they would be and the extra plush on them leave little room, just too small for my guys.  I do, however recommend it for smaller cats...say 5-9 pounds. Could be good for up to 2 small cats.  Please secure the base. It isn\'t a very heavy duty condo.\n
 The first elevated cat bed fell off after 3 months - the second one just oke today, after only 8 months.  Cheaply constructed, and the covering is thin, poor quality.  It seemed steady at first, but though the cat beds were tightened, they became loose quickly due to the bottom becoming stripped out.  The cats are not huge - one is 10 lb, one is 7.  Very disappointed this didn\'t last longer.\n
 I did a lot of research on cat trees before I finally decided on this one. I\'m so happy with my decision and</>so are our cats. We have two strays we adopted and the mama cat whose name is Mama (what a coincidence,</>right?) and her son love this "condo" Mama sits in the highest part and Oliver sleeps in the lower one. They don\'t</>use the kind of S shaped thing but some cats might. It is very sturdy and looks very nice.\n
 This is a great cat tree with cat house!  It is well made, sturdy, and nice looking.  I have a 12 pound adult kitty and she loves it.  She takes daily naps in the house.  She loves the hanging "balls"....she batts at them every night.  I will say the two tall "bed" levels are a bit too small for her. She will jump up on them....but she will not lay down.  All in all I recommend this unit!\n
 I got this scratching post for my two new kittens and they LOVE it!  They were about 1 month old when I got them from their shelter and immanently they loved it.  They love the 3 hanging balls to play with and they also love to play with each other, one inside of the hole and one outside.  The beds up at the top are very comfortable and one of them sleeps there every night (well almost every night).  I fell that they have decreased the amount of scratching that they do on the furniture due to the many well placed scratching surfaces on the arrangement.  I would recommend this to anyone and I feel that the money was very well spent.\n
 My 5 month old kitten LOVES this cat tree.  She loves to lay and play on it, and I think even as she grows it will still be a good size for her.  It was packaged well when it arrived, and although it took some time to assemble, I found it overall to be pretty easy.  Just make sure your vacuum is handy - you\'ll have lots of little carpet pieces on your floor.  I would recommend vacuuming the cat tree once its assembled.\n
 This was exactly as expected, and really easy to put together! My kitten likes to play with the balls (they have little noise makers in 2 of them), sleep on the lower pedestal, and scratch around on it. I don\'t think she likes the little circle thing on the underside of the structure, the closed space, or the higher pedestal, and I\'ve never seen her scratch on the scratching posts (although she scratches on the carpeted parts).\n
 Bought this nearly a year ago.</></>Atheistically - it has not held up well.  The purpose of a cat tree is multiple places for kitty to scratch,  All the jute trimmings are frayed and in shambles.  Very messy.  Disappointed and tired of restringing pieces of jute.</></>Structurally - it is sound.  Never been knocked over by 4 energetic 1 year old kitties.\n
 If I were able to rate this a zero, I would! This is a piece of junk. I ordered this on June 3rd and both beds are already oken. My cat is not a huge cat, so there is no excuse for this to be oken. The lower bed oke first and then the second bed oke. The unfortunate thing was that my cat was on the second bed when it fell to the ground. Now she is terrified of this piece of crap. $75 wasted in one month.\n
 Caboose loves his cat tree. I live in a small apartment, so there\'s not much room for my active little kitty to run around.  I spent a long time looking around for a cat tree that had more for a cat to do than lay around on, and this ended up being the perfect choice.  The scratching posts, ball toys, and interesting climbing options give him all sorts of ways to jump about when he\'s feeling antsy.  The balls are not flimsy, and are on stretchy (but very sturdy) strings.  I don\'t think Caboose will be able to chew through the strings, and despite his interest in phone charging cables etc. seems uninterested in destroying his toy.  The balls are covered in scratching post material, so he can hang on to them and Tarzan himself off the tree.</></>Even in my small apartment this tree looks great.  The color is nice, and all the fun pieces of it make it less of an eyesore than most cat trees.</></>Pros:</>- Attractive</>- Very sturdy (doesn\'t even shake when Caboose jumps directly to the second tier, or when he hangs off the ball stick toys.</>- Easy setup.  Took about 10 minutes total and required very little instruction-reading.</>- No shedding problem (~3 months so far).  The cat tree is covered in a fake fur type stuff that\'s really soft and doesn\'t shed.</>- Cat loves it</></>Cons:</>- Really none I can think of, though sometimes I\'m afraid caboose will hurt himself because he plays with this so vigorously!\n
 This cat condo is perfect. I bought it for 2 kittens I have, they are only 2 lbs each so they are very small but they already love it. It feels very sturdy and I don\'t think it could possibly tilt over even with a very large cat on it. It was easy to put together, I had it assembled and ready to go in 5-10 minutes. The cats love the toy balls and play with them constantly.\n
 Very nice condo for cats! Love the color, nice soft and plush. Very easy to assemble within 20 minutes. Condo area nice and roomy for  my large cat~she loves it!\n
 I&# ;ll start by saying this Tree seems to be much better quality than the past THREE I&# ;ve purchased (all have oken), so that&# ;s positive! I am however, concerned about the hammock design because the wood is flimsy &amp; the design doesn&# ;t seem solid. It also looks odd. I put a square scratch structure on top of it in an effort to make it more secure? I also recommend facing the cubby, on the bottom, outward instead of inward, when putting together. Better accessibility.</>Now for my complaints... the wood is very slippery so the first times my cats tried to jump on, they sipped off &amp; now, are skeptical to use.(I&# ;ll add material)  Also, for the price, I feel there are not NEARLY enough , strategically placed and staggered, steps/surfaces (based on picture I thought it was better than reality) to safety &amp; easily get cats to top. I&# ;ve had to add blocks, stairs and more, to make it moderately better to navigate. Alterations are hideous so I need to figure out permanent fixes.\n
 This is wonderful and easy to put together.  My cats love it.</></>I purchased this product with the intention of placing it within a catio (outdoor enclosure for cats), since it\'s made of wood, and will hopefully withstand various weather conditions.  I assembled the cat tree prior to building the catio, so it was in my home for several weeks.  It wobbled when my cats used it, (but the wobbling didn\'t bother them at all, as it was slight, and posed no danger to them, as it\'s solidly made), but when the unit was placed outside, in the catio, on my wooden deck, it didn\'t wobble at all.  But I think this is due to the flooring.  I purchased flooring (black mat) from kennelfloor.com., so the surface eliminated the wobbling.  Kennelfloor sends you the exact size you need.</></>[I purchased the catio (cage) from Amazon:&#160;\n
 We have had this tree for just over 3 years. NEVER has any previous tree we have purchased lasted this long because we didn\'t invest in quality. We have 2 very energetic cats around 10# each and one more relaxed guy who comes in at 22# (gray tabby around Maine Coon in proportions). They all love this tree. We have it in a corner of our living room to allow transit from floor to entertainment center to shelves running towards the ceiling along one wall. We never had an issue with stability, but after 3 months of owning it, we did use a acket to stop the cats slamming the tree into the wall. Our big guy fits both houses just fine, he loves squeezing in. After 3 years, we only just had sisal start to unravel on 3 poles, but that is not a problem, Armarkat sells replacement parts for all of their trees. My only wish is to sell those parts here on Amazon. I highly recommend the investment in Armarkat premium trees.\n
 Finally found an affordable cat tree that is nice and tall, looks nice, and has wood instead of carpet or faic! Triple win! If you have multiple cats, you\'ll know after a few years that it is much easier to wash blankets and beds than trying to vacuum hair/wash a mess off of a cat tree!</>Just assembled this today.</>For securing it to the wall, I found a stud, and predrilled holes through the back of the plywood box at the top. Then I drilled some long screws into the stud. The top is sturdy. The bottom is sturdy and there is still a little wobble in the middle AND on the hammock side. But, I feel much better for regular cat use that way. If you put it in a corner it might be more sturdy. Will update if it\'s not working in future, screws are a lot cheaper than trying to buy a furniture strap, and a lot more aesthetic! I love that someone stained theirs!</>The middle shelves are big enough to fold regular blankets on for cat beds, as shown. I was able to assemble it myself, you will need a chair or stepstool for assembling the top. If you don\'t need something quite as tall, you could leave the top box off and use it elsewhere in your house. Thanks Armarat, for a cool product!\n
 The super large box had disintegrated by the time it arrived to my doorstep &amp; large portions were missing from a 89&#8221; solid wood cat tree. I took detailed pictures of the box before &amp; after unpacking &amp;  laying out all contents. Several pieces were badly damaged &amp; 3 crucial pieces were missing.</>A 45 minute phone call with Amazon resulted in Amazon requesting missing parts from Armarkat who never responded despite my repeated attempts to follow-through. Amazon offered for me to purchase another box, pack it &amp; haul the box (weighs more than I weigh) to a place to be picked up. There&# ;s no opportunity to do that where I live.</></>It&# ;s a very expensive loss.\n
 This cat tree is almost perfect. I wanted a tall tree, and this one delivers. It reaches almost to the top of my 8\' ceiling, with just enough room for my Maine Coon to wedge himself between the top of the upper box and the ceiling (of note, my cat is a runt, considerably smaller than most full-grown cats of his eed).</></>I was concerned about stability given the small base, but it wobbles only slightly during play and does not bother my cats in the slightest.</></>I had to take away 1 star only because the wood, while very durable, is very hard and leaves nothing for the cats to grab onto causing them to sometimes slip off the platforms. Adjusting the positions of the smaller platforms has helped somewhat and they are getting used to it, but I can tell they still have some difficulty in maneuvering around certain spots. I will probably try strategically attach some sisal mats to the problem areas, but it would be awesome if this tree came with some sort of solution to this problem (other than carpeting, which my cats can shred in about a day).</></>A note about the packaging: the tree comes disassembled and packed into a square box with NO protection between the wood and the cardboard. I assume the manufacturer believes the wood will offer enough protection on its own, but my box arrived in very poor condition with the wood showing through in several places. One of the pieces arrived mildly chipped as a result of the box clearly having been carelessly handled, which isn\'t surprising given the substantial size and weight. I hope the manufacturer ups their packaging game slightly in the future.</></>TL;DR - This cat tree is way better for rambunctious young cats than any of the cheaper ones I\'ve owned, but does have one flaw in that it\'s hard for cats to climb and grip onto in places. Overall, well worth the price.\n
 My cats immediately were all over this thing and love to play around on it. They also sleep in here and love to sit up high to watch the birds, squirrels, etc., in the tree tops. The hammock is great and so are the cubbies for lounging and sleeping. My only complaint is that the bottom of it moves around slightly, so occasionally I have to push it back towards the window and wall in the lanai. We also have it on a slick rug. It might be different on the floor. We do not have it bolted down. The levels themselves will move, like for example, the hammock will turn, but can easily be turned back to the desired position. My boyfriend says I did not tighten them enough when I put it together myself. Regardless it is a great purchase and very sturdy and steady for how tall it is! It is so easy to assemble. I know my cats love having something tall to climb on and play on. I also like that there is not a lot of carpet on it. I think that can look dirty, and I like the aesthetics of the wood. My cats do not seem to mind. I might add my own fluffy carpet to some on the wood planks so they have something to grip. However, I would buy it again!\n
 My cat loves this tower. She loves perching up high, and sometimes will jump on top of the topmost house. She is young and active and has no problems using this tower that others mentioned with their cats. The tower is not bolted down and does shake a bit. However, that does not seem to bother her. The tower is pushed up against a wall in my apartment. I love love love that this tower does not become a furry mess like other ones I\'ve had that were all faic! My cat doesn\'t seem to mind it\'s texture at all. In fact, she initially preferred the hammock, but now likes to sleep on the top wooden platform. The soft parts (hammock and house padding) are removable and washable, should fur accumulate. Also was so easy to assemble, I was able to do it by myself, which  never happens with anything to do with assembly for me! I also had people ask me for the place to get one themselves, because it looks really nice.\n
 Great for my blue lion (Norwegian forest) as he loves to climb and run up and down, definitely can handle his weight.  Love the no carpet hassle and the cushions provided are very plush and easily removable as well as washable.  This is great if you don&# ;t want to deal with cleaning off long cat hair or suffer allergies as well as providing solid height and differing options of relaxing for your fur baby.  Totally worth it and installation process was so easy in less than 20 mins unlike the vesper cat tree (love that one too but omg a pain to install that took hours).  If this been on your list to get, don&# ;t hestaitate!  If any parts are damage, contact seller and easily get it resolved too! All worth it\n
 My dad was able to put it together in just under 2 hours.  It was fairly straightforward to assemble.  But, for some reason the faic for the hammock was very difficult to put on which added to the time to assemble.  I don\'t know if the pockets were not big enough or if the wooden frame that the faic goes over was too big, but it was a struggle.  The structure does wobble a bit once you put pressure on it like a cat would while jumping on it.  I\'ll probably put something on the base to weigh it down.  It does look nice assembled though.\n
 It took us forever to chose a cat tree. We wanted something tall enough to make our cats feel safe from our dog and guest, something small enough to not take up our entire home, and something aesthetically appealing that could fit with the decor of our home. The lack of carpet makes this so much classier than the average tower. However, I do wish it would have came with a anchoring strap, as it wobbles when the cats jump up on it, so we had to put our 50lb kettle bell on the bottom to stabilize it. Unfortunately it still wobbles, so will have to figure out how to anchor the top half to the wall. I also suggest that they offer it in different wood stains and move the lower cat house up further since cats prefer to higher places.\n
 This is the highest-quality and of cat trees available!  I\'ve had other cat trees with poor quality construction and materials that I\'ve had to throw out in a short amount of time, but Armarkat is made with excellent-quality materials, construction and design.  After trashing two other cheaper cat trees, I did some research on ands and looked at reviews: Armarkat is the best!!!  I first bought another smaller Armarkat for my bedroom, and I was amazed at the superb quality, design, materials, construction, and how easy it was to put together.  I have 4 rescue cats who love it and it\'s very sturdy!  A couple of reviews on this taller cat tree were concerned about it tipping over, but I haven\'t had that problem.  I did not weigh down the base with anything extra (one person said he used a granite slab), but my 4 very active crazy cats can do nothing to even get slightly close to tipping it.  The design makes sure that it stays in one place and I just have it sitting in my living room on my wood floor next to the sliding glass doors.  During what I call "kitty play hour" at night, they are running and jumping all over it and there\'s no way it will tip over.  I love the smooth polished solid wood and the sisal rope as it is low-maintenance.  I don\'t have to vacuum any carpet and the sisal rope covered poles are excellent additional cat-claw scratching posts.  I have additional sisal rope scratching posts in my condo since I have 4 cats, but this does double duty for play, relaxing and scratching; my cats love the extra-tall height of this tree!  Also, sisal rope is the best on cat trees and scratching posts; carpet just gets shredded by the cats and ends up all over my floor.  I will NEVER buy any other and of cat tree other than Armarkat!  I threw away a lot of money in the past on cat trees that looked good, but they were of cheap quality.  The quality and workmanship Armarkat beats all other cat trees on the market!!!\n
 let me start off by saying, this thing is HUGE! I have nine foot ceilings and if yours are any smaller this will not fit. It didn\'t actually take me long to put together 30-45 mins although the top part will definitely require a ladder. The enclosures are actually large enough to fit my fat cats lol (for reference they\'re 13-15 lbs and its still roomy.) Sadly only one of my cats like it although I occasionally see two of the others on there. If you\'re cat is okay with a bit of wobble and you have the space I would say go for it.\n
 I have struggled with purchasing a cat tree for my two kitties..one big reason is my Gracie girl chews and ends up eating chewed items. I had gotten a small cat tree once that had carpet and she would find the smallest part of the unraveling edge and chew and try to swallow the plastic that is in the carpet.</>and then there is the fear of a cat tree being structurally strong.</>I finally came across this one and after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try, especially since its wood.!!</>I received it yesterday and put it together last night. it was super easy to put together.</></>MAN, is this a great cat tree!!! the wood is a good thickness and very durable and it feels structurally sound!</>it does have a small wobble to it (I had read about this in other reviews) so I did get a 12x12 stepping stone and placed it in the middle of the base, to give myself assurance of keeping it from tipping over if they get to playing too rough, they sometimes do..lol. (that\'s why the blue towel is there, it\'s wrapped to keep the cats from hurting themselves)  :)</>and I did leave off the hammock piece, because I\'m worried my 17# Gordy may ing it down if he sat in it..</>I put them on the middle shelf last night and they sat for a second and then jumped off. Gracie did get in the cubby on her own and napped..so in time they will start playing on it..it\'s like with anything, if we didn\'t want the cats on it they would be all over, instead they aren\'t paying it much attention..haha</>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAT TREE!!</></>Also, I had ordered through Link Depot and received it in like 5 business days..and paid a cheaper price than what Amazon\'s original posted price.\n
 Having multiple cats of size and weight I have owned many a cat trees.  This is the BEST!  I also have a small house so it takes up little floor space.  But the height and many levels allows the cats to climb, jump, sleep and look out the window.  The solid wood makes it very stable.  And the eventual accidents are much easier to clean from bare wood rather than fur or fleece.  Eventually, the sisal goes on all of them but with the price so reasonable, I can always buy another one.  This will always stay on my Wish List.\n
 Perfect cat tree for a studio apartment. It\'s very tall and narrow, so it doesn\'t take up much space. But it\'s also much sturdier than I was expecting for how narrow the base is. My 10-lb cat doesn\'t shake the tree at all when she hops around on it, though I\'d probably recommend weighing down the base (as recommended by other reviewers) if you have an especially large cat or multiple adult cats.</>One complaint: I got a couple of rope splinters when putting the tree together. But the instructions were very easy to follow, and with the help of a friend, we had it up in less than 15 minutes.\n
 My son had it put together in minutes and he did it by himself. It is all wood and sisal rope. No carpet, faux fur or cardboard. The wood and manufacturing are excellent in quality and it is a beautiful cat tree/tower. She uses it every day and thoroughly enjoys observing her kingdom from the top wooden platform. I am so glad we got the tall tower. She loves to climb.  She doesn&# ;t care to get into the hammock. But she loves to hit it from underneath and watch all the jingle bell balls rain down. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Thank you.\n
 My cat loves it. He started climbing on it as soon as I finished assembling it. It&# ;s very well made. The raw wood was clean so I was able to stain it to match my furniture. Came out great and my wife is happy that it doesn&# ;t look like those carpeted ones.\n
 My cats love this tree! Its extremely tall so make sure it will fit in your house. We have tall ceilings so it works great. The tree rocks a little bit, but its not going to fall over and my cats don\'t mind it. Highly recommend it for agile cats. If your cat is older or a little clumsy, I recommend getting a carpeted tree with a bigger base to give them more traction and stability.\n
 Many of the questions were about the finish. This is not coated with varnish or polyurethane. The wood is bare but well-sanded and ready for paint except for a bit of sanding on corner edges. We gave it two coats of paint prior to assembly and it looks wonderful. Best of all, my cat adores this tree! The top box with its removable cushion and the hammock, which also has a removable and washable cover, are her favorite places. She loves the height. I used two shims under the front edge which has made it super sturdy as she leaps up and down the tree. It rocked a bit prior to shimming.\n
 I love this cat tree. My cat LOVES this cat tree. He\'s a Bengal. It is very tall. I can just touch the top box (not the top of it though)\n
 This is a great cat tree, my cats LOVE it.  Just want to add that I followed other reviewer\'s advice and placed a large piece of granite on the base to stabilize it- I\'m not sure how stable it would be without it, as the base is pretty small.\n
 Great cat tree. I really love the look of this tree. It was very easy to assemble and my cats were all over it as soon as it was up and one even before. I have multiple 15+ pound cats and they fit into the condos just fine. The tree does move or wobble a bit when they are climbing, but not enough for me to worry that it will fall over. My only warning would be that your cats just may fall off of it if they are used to carpeted cat trees. Mine have been playing on it and since there is no carpet for them to get their claws into, they have fallen off. No injuries and I haven\'t seen any one fall a second time, so they learned. I plan to do as another reviewer suggested and Velcro some carpet remnants down for added traction.  Overall it\'s a great piece.\n
 I love Armarkat poducts.  They are well made and really easy to put together. I got this last night and put it together in about 15 minutes.  My cats love it! It is a little top-heavy IMHO so I think I\'ll use a ace.  I got it in 2 days.  Comes in a big box and it\'s pretty heavy.\n
 great cat tree, relatively sturdy considering the height.</></>minus 1 star because it is "easy" to assemble but the double sided screws were tough to do. Also with the extra tall height... it really needs some sort of ceiling ace or wall anchor included to stop the wobbling. I anticipated this issue though.\n
 we had to thicken threaded studs with plumber &amp; elect tape to stabilize the posts; hammock did not fit frame and the tower came in a damaged box because it was too heavy, so how do you return it?\n
 I have been watching this and and model for months. After finally deciding to make a purchase, the product arrived earlier than expected, as advertised and at a better price than I have seen yet. I would highly recommend this product and this seller.\n
 Our cats LOVE this tree. Easy to assemble. The wood on platforms was nicely finished, but a little slippery. We added carpeting to ours. Great scratching poles, good for climbing. A little wobbly standing alone so we wedged it between our countertop and molding. Small adjustments may be needed...but worth it!\n
 This tree is not solid wood. Some of its solid wood. But the structural parts are made of cardboard or hardboard/ plastic ended tubes. In other words hollow. In the end it didn&# ;t matter because it&# ;s missing one of the tubes and it&# ;s going back anyway.\n
 Although I love the way this wood looks it is very user unfriendly for my kitties. They have nothing to grab and end up falling off the tree. Not good. I spent money and much time to add carpet to tops of platforms so that they could use it. Pretty but dangerous.\n
 Our cats love this. Took them a while to explore all the way to the top but love that there\'s no carpeting for them to shred and leave all over the apartment, the all sisal posts are great for their scratching habits\n
 My cats just love this. They were climbing it before I had finished putting it together. This is their favorite plaything. Thanks to one of my favorite authors for recommending Armarkat.\n
 Like many have posted, it needs a bigger base. My cat is small and it still wobbles so much! She doesn\'t seem to like it very much, will work on attaching a board to the base when I can.\n
 Two weeks in, our cats loooove it! It\'s well made, looks great. They can\'t stop climbing on it. Wasn\'t hard to assemble, either.\n
 It\'s great. My 2 cats love it because it is super tall. Heed the various warnings on here about weighting down the base, it definitely needs it. I love that there is no carpet and it is SO easy to clean.\n
 I do not like directions because they typically confuse the issue; however, these were written with me in mind.  Its sturdiness and overall ability to make my cat run &amp; jump &amp; play make it a 5 and it is attractive too.</>I am pleased with my purchase and you probably will be too but remember the platforms are solid wood.  Thus its durability.\n
 I own a Norwegian Forest cat and he loves this! Perfect height and hiding spaces to keep him entertained.\n
 Fantastic product- great shipping !!\n
 A Beautiful cat tree. Highly recommend. Our 3 all grown up cats have tons of fun in it. It wobbles a little when they play hard. We put 2 cement blocks on the base board, just in case. A great addition to our furniture.\n
 It came in a big box with lots of parts. However, the manual was easy to read and super easy to assemble. Although it seems quite sturdy I was worried my crazy cats would launch themselves during play and eventually knock it over. Solution: buy one of those "L" acket things from the hardware store and voila! Instant security!</>My cats loooooove the upper room and pad and I love that they scratch on the rope-covered posts!\n
 A little wobbly, will use other reviewers suggestion and place a heavy block to hold it in place.\n
 very nice done, price good. pretty tall and I got two of them already!\n
 My three cats frequently play and sleep on it.  It stands against a wall, and is an attractive piece in my living room.\n
 My cats love these.  We have three cats and bought three of these for different parts of the house.  They are easy to build, very sturdy and look great. Very high quality, definitely not cheap materials like so many other cat towers. The scratching posts at the bottom are really tall, which is something often neglected by other manufacturers.\n
 We have two adult cats of average size and this is the first cat tree we purchased for them. Our grey cat spends many hours lounging atop the perches and occasionally sleeps inside the house. The other cat immediately took to scratching up the posts in fits of obsessive fury - so much so that, within a few weeks, the sisal rope was completely shredded and I discovered what the posts are made of: cardboard! Hollow cardboard cylinders, wrapped with thin sisal rope. If I had caught it in time, I could have prevented permanent damage to the structure. However, I did not notice just how much our cat loved scratching the post until a large hole (about 5" long) had developed! It was at this point that I went to Lowe\'s and purchased much thicker sisal rope to re-wrap each column (all were showing similar signs of wear, just none as advanced as the favorite post). The cats have been using this post for about a year now and it is time to re-wrap a couple of the posts again. The hammock is useless in our household since neither cat cares for it. The little ladder doesn\'t matter one iota to either cat, nor does the small platform it attaches to. It does assist in adding stability to the tower, though. We haven\'t had any problems with wobbling, but the tower is also on a tile floor. I can envision it wobbling if placed on carpet. The own carpeting tends to show fur rather easily but I still prefer it over boring beige. All in all, I do like this cat tree. It doesn\'t look terrible in the home and doesn\'t eak the bank, either.\n
 Easy to put together AND well made. I was surprised at how nice it is in person. I always say shopping online is similar to dating online, since things (and people) can easily be altered to look super perty.</></>Our cat, Finn, is in 57-inch high heaven. Finally, he can jump up on something high and not be immediately accosted by weird sounds from the humans, who are also snapping their fingers and lurching toward him to get him while shouting get down, g-d**nit! I swear he really is smiling. Can\'t blame him.</></>Seriously, I honestly did do a lot of research to find a good value-for-the-money cat tree that doesn\'t take over a third of your living space, and this does not disappoint.  If I had the capital, I would gare-anne-tee your complete satisfaction. But I don\'t have that power, and I\'m not even a Vine member; I just felt compelled to review this while I had a few minutes. I thought there might be other cat owners sitting at their screens who are thinking, good lord, this is like shopping for a refrigerator: So. Much. Information. Head. Will. Explode. In 3-2-....</></>If anything changes in the product rating, I will update. That I can gare-anne-tee!\n
 My cats love the tree, and spend hours sleeping, and fighting over the top shelf. It\'s been almost a year since I set up the tree, and it\'s held up well. It sways a little when the heavier cat jumps up, or if both of my cats are playing on it, but it\'s never fallen over. If I had a more permanent place for it to be set up, I would screw it down to the floor. The scratching posts are starting to fray, especially the post holding up the top shelf.</>Overall, the tree was very easy to set up, even with two curious cats trying to figure out what I was doing, and it is definitely a naptime favorite.\n
 My smallest cat @ 7# loves it but managed to rip the fur the very first time she got on it. My large cat @ 16#\'s will not even get on it. The scratching posts are much smaller around than our old one. We are already making plans to Beef this up a bit. Wish I would have ordered my other choice.\n
 Like everyone\'s reviews said, it is wobbly the higher up our cat goes. She\'s 12.6# and seems to like it (although she was much more interested in the box it came in... Typical)  She\'s not a fan of hammocks to begin with, but she most definitely wouldn\'t fit in the one provided.  She doesn\'t use the ramp, but I think it\'s more for support anyways.  I like that the scratch posts are in the center of the individual platforms instead of at a corner of the square like on the other cat tree we have. And the price couldn\'t be better!\n
 ***DON\'T*** buy this! It is a POS. The "pressed wood" CRUMBLED as I was ATTEMPTING to connect the first piece to the base.  LITERALLY, no joke... the sisal Allen wrench screw "ate through" the "pressed wood" as I screwed it in place and within a minute of screwing the piece on (the FIRST piece) it separated from the base. The ONLY WAY this "tower" could ever be even assembled is if you loosely screw the pieces together and hope they are tight enough to hold it in place yet loose enough to not eak through the "pressed wood". And then hope that your cat NEVER uses it. I have assembled COUNTLESS items with pressed wood. This makes cardboard look like mahogany.\n
 The cats love it. Easy to assemble. 4 stars because it is a bit wobbly but other than that its awesome. Comes just as described and I have been having almost a year. Still in great shape. The cats have worn 1 scratching post out but I just had to rotate and I know I can swap it later down the road too with one that does not get used as much.\n
 Lasted only about 10 months of part time use (we have 2). Was wobbly from the start, and eventually, the ramp oke. The scratching post rope shredded very easily compared to our other/older tree, and the last straw was that one of the perch stands completely oke and toppled over in the middle of the night. Don\'t bother with this cat tree.\n
 Our cats seem to really like it.  Had to drill new holes to move the ackets on the steps/ladder piece so it would line up with the other holes on the first perch and fit together properly (they were about .25" off) but that was the only thing that needed adjusting to fit together properly (as per the instructions).\n
 Best investment I\'ve made.  I\'ve purchased many cat perches before but this one seems to captivate my cat the best.  It was easy to put together and doesn\'t take up a lot of room.  I took out the bottom hammock as my cat didn\'t seem to be interested in that at all... otherwise, great product and worth the money.\n
 please think carefully about your cats and do not buy this product. I put all of the negative reviews aside and bought myself this cat tower with high expectations that it would be perfect for my two flame-points, but unfortunately for me, it was far from that.</></>when I first purchased this cat tower and it arrived at my front door, I was more excited than I\'ve been in the longest time. I was glad I had finally gotten something I thought my cats would enjoy as there seemed to be a lot of things to do and play with, and I love spoiling them.</></>when I ought the two boxes inside of my house, I opened them and started assembling the cat tower by laying the scratching posts and objects in front of me so I could build it properly.</></>I first noticed how many nails there were stapled horribly into one of the cat houses, and this one was the cat house that lies on the top along with the stairs.</>this cat house was also cracked on both front ends of the cardboard; pieces were coming off as I carefully placed it onto the floor. I had figured that happened due to rough shipping, but then I noticed another cat house that belonged on the bottom of the cat stand. this house had numerous nails poking upward so that your poor little felines paws would get punctured when they take cover in the house, or when they play. these nails weren\'t just in the front of the house, they were also inside placed vertically.</></>I have never in my life seen such a dangerous cat stand.. Go Pet Club should\'ve used screws to assembly this cat tower, NOT nails that were clearly misplaced or just tackily put in without thinking of what it would do to the feline.</></>I got cut in numerous places on my fingers trying to get these objects out of the box, and I\'m worried because I haven\'t gotten a tetanus shot. I could only imagine what a days worth of playing on this thing would\'ve done to my cats. besides, I ordered what was supposed to be a NEW cat stand, not one that was refunded as there was another cats fur on this.</></>I hope you\'ll make a wise decision and get something better for your cat(s) rather than this accident waiting to happen.. you\'ll also be saving your money. thankfully for me, amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund.\n
 Our old cat tree was on the way out, and I really didn\'t want to get one with the bells and whistles that the cats either destroy (hanging toys) or ignore completely (ramps, toys on springs) so when I saw this, I was optimistic. Platforms and scratchers, that\'s all I needed.</></>I love how compact it is, while still being tall enough for the cats to survey the land. We have 2 cats: one is a ~8lb short hair, the other is a Maine Coon that\'s 20lb of love and fluff, but he can move the fluff around for sure. He has no trouble jumping up top and taking a nap, and even fits on the 2nd from top platform. There\'s a little wobble just because, you know, 20lbs, but nothing where I\'d be concerned about the overall stability of it.</></>The smaller cat is more interested in the hideaway on the bottom and the scratching posts.</></>I didn\'t put the leaves on since it felt like they\'d be destroyed in an instant. Overall this is such a good value and exactly what I needed.</></>I hope you found this review helpful in deciding whether or not to purchase this. If you did find it helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the link below. Thanks!\n
 I hope this review will serve as a warning to anybody with large cats who is considering buying this product. I bought this new cat tree for my 2 adult male cats. It is a lovely cat tree, especially with the earthy colors and the decorative foliage. But it is way too small, and dangerously so.</></>My cats are 12lb and 14lb, so it\'s not like they are grossly overweight (in fact, the 12lb one is very thin). Even my smaller cat can\'t fit comfortably into the baskets, and when he does, the entire top 2 sisal segments bend over like the leaning tower of pisa (there is nothing to stabilize it at the top). The main problem is that the sisal posts are too thin and cannot support a lot of lateral weight from the basket (my other cat trees have much thicker, sturdier sisal posts). It looked unstable so I tried to keep my cats out of the top basket, but I can\'t supervise them 24/7. When my 14lb cat tried to nap in the top basket, the entire top portion with the 2-segment sisal post completely snapped off! I\'m going to upload a picture if I can. The parts were screwed on tightly as they should be, but the plastic center of the sisal post completely ripped out from the screw due to the weight of my cat. The manufacturer should have included some kind of a weight limit warning! I\'m pretty upset because my cat could have been seriously injured when the tree suddenly snapped and he pummeled down unsuspectingly, and I want to warn anybody who has large cats.</></>If I could unscrew the whole thing and fit it all neatly back into the shipping box, I would return it. But that would probably be impossible. So I use it for my foster kittens now, in a separate room. They love it, and it\'s perfect for them (they are about 1-3 lb). However, it\'s still a oken cat tree that I paid over $300 for, and I only had it for 2 weeks. I contacted the manufacturer Go Pet Club for a replacement part so that I could mount the top piece again (for the little kittens), but they said since I bought it through amazon that I would have to contact them. Amazon said they could ship me an entire replacement, but could not replace just the one oken part. The manufacturer was polite, but basically said if I wanted a replacement part I had to purchase one from them...well I already spent $300 buying a poor quality cat tree, my cat almost got injured from the product, so I feel like they could have at least sent me one replacement part free of charge. The entire experience has left me disappointed and exasperated.</></>It\'s such a shame because I think this would be an awesome cat tree if they could somehow increase the size of all the parts. I would recommend this cat tree only if your cat is under 8lbs or so. I\'m not really sure how the previous reviewer\'s 3 large cats can use the tree without eaking it, but perhaps they just don\'t climb into the baskets. The 2 round cat perches are also too small for my cats to lay comfortably. There are probably only 2 places that a large cat could comfortably lounge on (the very top cubby and the bottom area). It is just not an appropriate cat tree for large cats.</></>On another note, my cats also chew on the fake leaves, and I\'ve had to clean up green cat vomit a few times until I finally removed the leaves. The tree doesn\'t look nearly as good without the leaves though. Also, the frame for one of the hammocks wouldn\'t screw together right so that the parts ended up not being completely flush with each other (they probably weren\'t cut right on my set).</></>Aesthetically, I\'d give this tree 4.5 stars. Quality - 3 stars. Endangering my cat - 0 stars. Minus a couple of stars for not replacing the oken sisal part.</></>Please put a weight limit on this cat tree!\n
 I purchased this item on 8/25/17 and it arrived in a timely manner. Set-up was simple. My cat enjoyed it for several months, spending her days relaxing on the different tiers. However, this all changed one horrifying evening. At first, it appeared as if our cat was simply playing near the top of the cat condo. Suddenly, she began violently kicking her back legs and scratching. This caught our attention and we watched with partial amusement, thinking that she was only playing.  After about 10 seconds of frantic kicking, our cat began making a horrific noise. We then knew something was very wrong. We ran over the to cat condo to discover that our cat was actually choking and that her frantic kicking with her back legs was temporarily preventing her from "hanging" herself. It turned out, while weaving in and out of the "monkey bars" near the top of the cat tree, my cat\'s neck became entangled in the loops of rope securing one of corners of the hammock. The rope was wound so tightly around her neck that I was having difficulty inserting scissors between her neck and the rope. As a physician, I can surmise that our cat had no more than a few seconds before asphyxiating. Luckily, I was able to free out cat and she lived to play another day. However, if this event had happened at night or while we were at work, I am certain we would have walked into our living room to find our cat dead. To those of you that have already purchased this item, throw it out OR remove the hammock.\n
 I just got it and I can\'t comment on the longevity of the item, but first impressions are hard to beat.</></>First, the carpet on here is so soft - I wasn\'t expecting that. I was expecting the standard scratchy stuff. It feels more like fake fur material (not really fluffy or thick), but it does the job nicely and feels good to the human touch.</></>Second, it only took about 20 min to put together.</></>Third, the stability is much better than I thought. I looked at several cat tree\'s varying in price from under $100 to over $300. This one seemed mid-range so I was expecting mid-range quality. Not at all. It is sturdy and strong. The basket was my biggest concern since my 12 lb cat loves the hammock style thing. It is made of metal inside, so I don\'t have to worry about it eaking like I would have if it was just a thin piece of wood.</></>Fourth, the look is just beautiful! I hadn\'t expected the leaves to come with (thought that was just dressing for the website pics), but they did. The overall look of this with and without the leaves is so wonderful that it looks just fine in my living room. I don\'t have to worry about it standing out as an eye-sore or feel like I have to explain to visitors that, yeah, that\'s the cat tree. It makes it\'s own statement.</></>Fifth, the design is wonderful! I\'ve seen many other cat trees, but this one seemed to have several different styles for the landings. Many have the flat landings and a "house". I\'ve seen several with the hammock type thing. But this was the first I saw with the half-barrel hide out. This has so many different elements, every cat is sure to find something it likes. Each of mine have at least two spots I\'ve seen them enjoy.</></>Last, the size is very nice. I\'m sure you can see the measurements and get an idea, but it is such a nice size I thought it worth mentioning. It is not small, by any means, but it is also not overpowering.</></>Well, that\'s my take on it so far. My kitties are enjoying it immensely. I love seeing them and it in my living room instead of hidden away in the bedroom.\n
 STELLAR CUSTOMER SERVICE: First, Amazon\'s customer service pulled through with flying colors when we had problems with shipping due to a couple mishaps by both Amazon and UPS. Our prime shipping turned into an 8 day arrival time even though our tree was only 30 miles from our front doorstep by day two at a UPS warehouse, and no one thought to first give us the chance to at least come pick it up ourselves on day three. It was a birthday gift to be given at the same time as two new kittens in a wonderful and surprising way, and that was ruined. We ordered it six days prior to when we absolutely had to have it to set it up for the gifting, even though it was marked "Prime Shipping," just to be safe and ensure we got it in time. We didn\'t, and it spoiled the kind of experience and surprise we wanted to create. However, Amazon always makes things right and in an extremely fair way, because they place the customer first and take responsibility. So we are 5-star pleased on that front with no hard feelings because of it.</></>CONSTRUCTION and MATERIALS: Second, if you\'re considering this particular tower, it\'s worth it. We saw in person several other ands and styles. All were way overpriced for the size and quality, some 1/3 the size of this without any thing but one shelf to sit on and a scratching post, but still $70! Others as large as this one were flimsy, cheaply made, and wobbled, or had no other creative activity spaces but one. This tree has many, and it is very sturdy. Any tree you buy at this height is going to have the potential to wobble or sway if you try and make it do that, like if you lean your full weight up against it or push it, or if two large cats jump on it and scramble up it at the same time. But the tree sways only a small bit when cats do that, and never to the extent that it may topple over. You can\'t avoid that at all with this height in respect to its base width. You would have to double the base size and use all solid 2x4s or 4x4 wooden posts. It will look more bulky, take up more space, and that kind of quality and construction is going to cost a lot if it still comes with all the various play levels, two houses, perch, and a feeding platform like this one does. For the pillars/scratching post base, this tree uses what many others use, rolled hollow cardboard tubes rather than top-heavy wooden posts that might topple over at this height, and wrapped in quality and highly durable sisal. However, many others use tubes of a smaller diameter making the weight from the height put too much pressure on them and they can eak or bend. While this tree uses 3" diameter posts, and not the 4-5" kind other models boast, it uses a lot more cardboard material for its tubes to create a thick and tightly rolled post that is incredibly sturdy and unbendable - short of driving a car over it, so don\'t let the diameter worry you with this particular tree. Not all 3" posts share that quality.</></>ASSEMBLING and HOUSES: Putting it together delivered a solid tree without anything loose, wobbly, or cattywampus. We laid out all the scratching posts according to their designated letter in order to make sure we didn\'t mix them up. We kept a lot of space between them so like E wouldn\'t roll over to F without our noticing. We laid out the hardware in the same way too. The instructions were easy to follow because my 16 year old son read them and directed me as to what to do. It went together easily. My husband gave every level\'s screw or post a last tightening without overdoing it of course. You don\'t want to strip anything and give reason to future instability. The houses are very different than many other trees too. Others between $80 and $130 price range had the material stretched over a frame, so the walls of the houses were just like a tent. Or, they were made out of very weak and cheap cardboard or flimsy particle board that quickly looked uneven and sloppy. (Display models at your local pet stores can corroborate this, testifying to how little use it takes to make some trees unsturdy or unappealing, as well as how little "extras" and platforms/houses they have on their trees for their price in comparison to this one.) This tower uses a 3/8" thick particle board for the house walls and 5/8" for the ceilings, and they are also very sturdily constructed, compacted well. Sure, if you put enough bendable pressure on the walls in ways it wasn\'t built for it is going to crack. How do I know this? I was trying to staple gun a hanging mouse over one of the door openings, and while the particle board is heavy duty enough to NOT allow a staple gun to penetrate the staple through its material flush, and only 1/3 of the staple went into it, when I hammered it as hard as was needed to sink it into the particle board, the board bent in with a crease about 2" and got a 3/4" crack. Most people know to not hammer particle board LOL ... doh!  So, unless you perform WWE wrestling moves on it, the houses will remain sturdy for years to come. No cat will be able to bend or crack it. The best part is the size. The largest cat can fit through the openings and they are extremely spacious inside. The top one could fit two full grown cats curled up, and the bottom could easily fit 3 or 4. They are fun. None of this kitten-sized-only stuff for only $40 less.</></>WATER/FOOD BOWL: Another favorite feature that makes this tower unique is the feeding dish on the middle platform. It is marketed as a water bowl. Uhhh, no. Not in my family room it isn\'t. I don\'t think that is wise at all, not so much because of the room it is in or the flooring it is on, but because of the cat tower itself. Water around any kind of particle board no matter how solidly crafted is never a good idea and softens and weakens it over time, if not immediately. Additionally, the wet material covering it might dry quickly all the way through, but it might not. Repeated exposure will create smell, mildew, etc. So we use it to feed them their dry food. They eat there every single day. No batting at water and getting the carpet and platform wet and soggy over time weakening its sturdiness. Just dry food. It\'s wonderful. Then in our kitchen there is a spot where we feed them their wet food. Their dry food bowl is always empty by the end of the night, and it\'s a rather large bowl too!</></>IVY LEAVES: Sure the kitties like to bat at the green ivy leaves, and the leaves are much cheaper than the quality you\'d buy at a craft store, comparable to a dollar store frankly. However, they are of the perfect shade of green that makes the ivory tower look lovely and elegant, not too dark and not too light. Too dark can create a messy or harsh look, and too light creates a cheap look. To be safe, we used a staple gun and stapled the ends of the vines into the platform "wood" (about 5/8" thick platforms,) and hammered them flush to the board below the carpet for safety, being careful with the hammering force, (but the platforms can handle a lot more than the house walls.) A 1/2\' staple worked best. Occasionally one of our little stinkers accidentally pulls a leaf off when using one of the scratching posts, but it\'s still not noticeable. The leaf can\'t be put back on unless you glue them with an immediate drying craft glue. I don\'t think you need to worry about the cats chewing the ivy. Ours don\'t, only bite at them once or twice now and then, but don\'t chew. They have grown accustomed to them just being a part of the tree, albeit sometimes in the way of their scratching. Eventually I\'ll exchange it out with a better quality ivy from Michael\'s that has the leaves attached by sliding the stem over another little stem sticking out of the the garland. Then they can just be placed back on when they come off. In the meantime, it is not a deal eaker or a reason to not use the ivy. The beauty of this tower is its ability to look classy in the most upscaled room possible, (better than ours,) because of the effect the contrasting green ivy leaves have with the ivory scratching posts.</></>SIZE: Don\'t fear that something so tall might look imposing or obnoxious in your home. Of course every home and room size offers different options for different sizes. If this were shorter, it might seem too bulky/wide, but at this height it looks more slender and narrow. Since I have included pictures of ours in our room and how we use it, it will be helpful for you to know that the room is 20\' long and 16\' wide. The wall in the photo that has the cat tree on the left of the fireplace and the artificial tree on the right side is 16\' across if that helps. Our ceilings are 9 feet. I\'ll admit that if you have standard 8 ft ceilings, it might be a bit intrusive to your space depending on the layout and size of your room, but with a large window nearby or good lighting and such, it can work. We previously had a second tall artificial plant in the spot we put the cat tree in, and this replaced it tastefully and quite easily to keep the balance on both sides of the fireplace. It is the best cat tree on the market today because a room can maintain its elegance while providing a playground for cats.</></>ACCESS TO EACH LEVEL: Our cats had no problem learning to climb to each level, and the top pedestal is their favorite spot.  Every level has an area that allows jumping to the next level unlike many other cat trees who have one or more levels directly above the lower one with nothing to jump from, and only the most determined and crafty cats will use the scratching posts to climb their way to the next level. Such a silly oversight if you ask me. Our cats use every single platform equally and energetically, chasing each other up and down the entire tower continuously to our amusement. They immediately made this their home, errrr Palace!, and their play yard. They get so much use out of it every single day, keeping them plenty busy and entertained, and we just know that wouldn\'t be true for most other towers. Some reviewers on this site or others might say they wish that the two outer platforms to get to the top house stuck out a bit further to give more space from which their cat can jump, but still love it regardless. I would have to agree, and about 1" more would do it nicely, however it might make the tower look too out of proportion, since it presently is perfectly proportioned. Some cats like ours have no problem. Since they learned it as kittens, they will have no problem as an adult. When compared to so many other towers, I don\'t see many large cats having any problem at all getting used to this, getting to each level and to the top, unless of course you own Garfield.</></>NOTE: Our photos - We have more toys hanging and attached than come with it. The mouse at the very top and the two ropes are what come with the tree and are sturdily attached, with the ropes using a very smart attachment style which is screwed into the upper base. But we added various other toys on other levels for more fun, so if you see any of those don\'t expect them to come with the tower.\n
 &#160;Very tall and classy tree!  Great for formal homes or any home that wants clean lines!  Its not very wide so will not take up much space.  Can fit in a corner but goes very high which cats live anyway!  ( 86" high )</></>I absolutely love this cat tree however it has taken my cat a few days to get used to it because he\'s not the type that gets overly excited. He\'s the type that kind of just stares at something and sniffs it.  He\'s curious and wants to know what everything is but he doesn\'t necessarily jump all over everything.</></>For a few days, I had to actually put him up top to show him that\'s what he\'s supposed to do.  He loved the hanging cat toys but remained uninterested in the tree. I started to get nervous that I would be wasting my money until I realized I needed to move the tree. originally had the tree in a corner so I moved the tree in front of the window.  Now, he loves it!  He can look out the window and watch the birds. He sometimes sleeps in the bottom house but enjoys the top platform more.  He doesn\'t fit in the smaller house on top so I actually took it off.  Now he can have a larger platform to lounge on.  It is not vital to put the small house on top if your cat won\'t use it.  You can even remove the top perch so your cat can just have a flat top.</></>That tree is gorgeous but my only recommendation would be to make the steps wider and longer so that the cats don\'t struggle too much to get down because my cat is a bigger cat and he almost slipped off the top in the beginning when he tried to put his paw down onto one of the sides. He\'s not a huge cat but I think the two side steps that are right below the top should be a little bit wider and longer for a more ease in motion.  Other than this, it\'s great!  He has gotten used to it more n more and no lo get has trouble getting down.  It would have been better if the two side steps were wider however, cats are very versatile and can figure things out!  If your cat/cats are small, I would say put the house on top with the perch but if they are bigger, it might be better to keep the top flat!\n
 We just received ours today, and I was so excited to put it together. I was not disappointed. It was extremely easy to assemble, and it only took about 30 minutes. The only reason it took 30 minutes is because our cat could not wait to use it. He was rubbing on everything and exploring the houses as we were assembling it. Once we finished putting it together, our cat started using it almost immediately. I am not really sure who is more excited about the tree between myself and the cat though!\n
 I couldn\'t even get this out of the box and both my boys were so excited; one was chattering. I put half of it together and had to stop because they were so happy and playing on it, boxing each other for the top spot. After several hours, they finally let me finish putting it together. It took about 20-30 minutes total-it was pretty easy. Once finished, the boys didn\'t leave this cat tree for hours. They hop, jump, wrestle, box each other and sleep on this. It appears to be pretty sturdy-they play hard on it and one of the boys is 20 pounds. After researching countless cat trees, I\'m very happy I went with this one!!\n
 Functions wells and very sturdy. I have a large cat and 2 dogs. My cat and smaller dog both climb on the condo and enjoy it very much. It is durable and has many different tiers. The only downside is the leaves are cheap and the water bowl spills when there\'s a ton of movement on the condo\n
 This is a great unit BUT - be prepared for a really fun assembly experience!</></>1. When you are notified that the unit will be delivered I suggest you obtain a generous supply of your favorite adult beverage. You\'re gonna need it.</>2. You will also need a measuring tape, a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers.</>3. When the package arrives, actually there are two of them, clear out a LARGE space to assemble it very near its final location. This sucker is HEAVY and not easily moveable.</>4. I suggest you open the boxes outside and carry the parts to your assembly spot. The boxes are heavy!</>5. Sort the parts by size and the bolts / screws by bag number.</>6. The assembly directions are picture only. NOTE THAT THE DARK OWN PARTS ARE RRPRESENTED BY SLIGHTLY SHADED ICONS AND NOTE THAT SOME HAVE HOLES THAT YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE PROPERLY OR YOU ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF CORRECTIVE DISASSEMBLY!</>7. Have a drink!</>8. When you assemble the bottom locate the proper position of the pieces by using the center piece as a template for the holes. In fact, the best way to locate the flat pieces as you go is to use the position of their holes relative to the front and rear.</>9. Have another drink.</>10. When assembling the bottom it helps to balance it on the long side and have someone steady it while you insert the bolts as shown. Then let it down quickly so that they don\'t fall out OR tape them to the bottom to keep them in place.</>11. Have another drink.</>12. Now start screwing in the poles as shown. You will have a letter and a length listed on the assembly picture instructions. BE VERY CAREFUL TO MEASURE THEM AS YOU GO! Be sure that they correspond to the appropriate length on the last page of the directions or you will have crooked platforms and have to disassemble your mistakes.</>13. Apply adult beverages as necessary during the rest of your task.</>14. The hammocks are the trickiest part. There are poles with studs in their sides and with holes through them that have to be located properly. Be sure you screw those poles in with all of the studs and holes at the same level and at the proper levels or . . . .</>Yeah, more corrective disassembly will be required. Don\'t forget to install the spacers between the upper and lower hammock poles!</>15. The last thing I assembled was the ladder. What to my wondering eyes did appear but that there was no acket to attach it to! This was solved by drilling some holes in the appropriate platform and using some half by one and a quarter bolts, nuts and washers.</>16. The whole thing took about three hours and six Edmund Fitzgeralds to complete. The cats love it!\n
 This is a great cat tree. I\'ll get to the point, I have 3 cats- a kitten and 2 adults. The largest weighs about 12-13 lbs and fits on the whole tree. The one condo is very large and would absolutely fit a very large cat.  I originally bought a \'huge\' cat condo that ended up being so small that it could not fit my cats im the hammock or the condo. I had to return it and purchased  this instead.  It took me about 20 minutes to put together, it was pretty easy.  It is an awesome  cat tree for the price and the perfect size for adult cats.  A large or overweight cat would not fit in the Hammock, however, they would absolutely fit in the condo  and every other part of the tree. I built it  yesterday and all three have been on it nonstop. Enjoy this cat tree, it\'s great! The fake leaves that come with it fall off somewhat  easily while they are playing, but I really really like them a lot so I added a stuffed monkey for a real jungle feel.  You can also buy more fake Garland leaves at the store for every holiday so it can be a Christmas or Halloween or fall tree with the leaves if you want to get festive with it. It is a great buy and I love it!\n
 Original April 2017 review:</>Looks great, easy to put together and the cats love it!! I put it together by myself and it took no time at all (I\'m a 5\'1&#8221; female). Took them a little bit to figure out how to get out of the top tunnel, but once they figured it out they\'re in and out all day.  I added feathers to the ropes for additional fun. At first I was worried about them ruining the leaves but they have held up very well.  They run up and down this thing all day, jump on and off it and it has remained stable and no signs of wear.</></>Update - 10/23/2019</>New kitten made quick work of the leaves a few weeks ago but they lasted wonderfully up until then. The rest of the tree is like new! I&# ;m very impressed how well it held up and you&# ;d never guess it&# ;s well over two years old. The top piece wiggles loose after a few months but easy to tighten. Highly recommend!!!\n
 Good tree could use at 1 or 2 more round hammocks my cat LOVES those. My cat loves sitting on top or laying up top and looking out over his "kingdom" and has been nick named King Calcifer. Its easy to put together but takes a long time. I wish they didnt use those stupid alan wrench type screws or at least include a tool that is magnetic or easier to keep hold of. The top bed wobbles even though everything is screwed in tightly its just bc it doesnt have anything preventing it from swaying since its just on a post. My cat doesnt go in the the "hidey holes" so those are a waste for us. But all in all its what I expected that way. But what I did expect and didnt get was there are no directions on HOW to attach the fake plants to the structure. You cant just wrap it and expect it to stay and look nice. I had to un screw the top base from the 2 front supports a bit and shove the ivy so it was pinched between the 2 and re screw it together to hold it on which was a PITA. Then wind it around then do the same at the bottom but this time the screws were on the bottom bigger PITA! Could easily be solved by putting loops on the ends of the ivy and including it in the instructions with those steps the screws are used in.\n
 Received my cat tower very quickly and had all the pieces. It was easy to put together and my kitten seems to really like it so far. The only problem I have is the vines. There is no real way to attach them to the tower and they are pretty short considering how tall the tower is. Other than that I like it and so does my little boy. Happy from West Virginia!</>****GO PET CLUB/AMAZON HAS NOT PAID ME TO WRITE THIS REVIEW****</></>UPDATE: Got home from work last night and found out my little kitty had been playing on the cat tree all day! Also woke up this morning and he was napping on the middle tier. He is in love and I am ecstatic.\n
 Pros:</>It is easy to assemble.</>Can be tucked into a corner.</>Looks good.</>Cats really liked the sisal rope on the columns.</>Has plenty of perches so my two cats don\'t fight over limited spots.</>Cons: The main perches are covered in faux fur that turned out to be really thin. Considering the steep angle, height and how close the perches were clustered together my cats preferred to climb the sides to get to the top but couldn\'t since the fur was so thin they couldn\'t dig their claws in properly to pull themselves up.</>The size turned out to be barely big enough for my cats to comfortably climb around on. If you have a cat that\'s any bigger than about 7 pounds they don\'t have much room.</>It\'s a little wobbly and a little too lightweight for me to completely comfortable with them engaging in their usual "king of the hill" battles on it.</></>Overall it was nice but we ended up stapling carpet remnants over the perches and put weights inside the "cave" at the bottom for added stability. My recommendation for the manufacturers would be to replace the fur with thick carpet, make the base wider and heavier and spread out the columns more.\n
 Okay, it\'s been a month since we got the cat tree, and after 5 weeks of intensive use by our little 9 month old tabby girls, I think I can give a fairly objective assessment of the cat tree.  So, here\'s the deal:</></>a) It\'s not Amazon Prime and slow boated to you from China.  You and your little boys and girls will be bored to tears waiting for it to be shipped to you.  Well, when it gets there, just be prepared to deal with the fact that it\'s almost 85 lbs of particle boards, low-pile carpeting and sisal wrapped particle board tubes. The quality seems decent, nothing seems flimsy, which is good.</></>b) The instructions (printed on one letter sized sheet and not exactly laser printer quality) are not entirely idiot-proof, as the individual pieces are not marked and keyed against being built the wrong way.  The instructions will assume that you have a tape measure handy and can figure out, say, the C columns from the A columns.  You would have to take all the components out of the box and mark them.  In mine, the platform on the very top of the tree (where the mouse on the bungie cord lay) did come with the sides not well nailed together, and I have to do some minor carpentry to nail/glue it back into place.</></>c) The assembly process isn\'t too strenuous given that you have the standard IKEA rechargeable electric screwdriver set with the allen key bit, and that you sort out and marked all the components beforehand, or else it\'ll be you digging through the parts trying to figure things out.  Securing the top apartment on the platform below is a headache - it\'s fastened from the bottom without any guiding pegs to pre-locate the one screw that locks it in place.</></>d) If you are assembling it with your furry boy or girl in the room, you\'ll notice that they will be extremely interested in helping.  My girls can\'t keep their paws off the tree during the assembly process.</></>e) Once complete, don\'t even bother putting the plastic vines up.  Your cats will chew on them, and it\'s not exactly healthy - I am not sure what Chinese plastics are made from, but it\'s certainly not rainbows and sunshine.</></>Overall, a good bit of kit.  It will get wobbly if you do not prop it up against, say, a corner, and if you have more than one cat, they will fight for a spot on that top platform.  The bottom apartment is next to useless as the cats will never go inside.  The food bowl on the middle platform will be used like a gong by your cat(s) as they take turns knocking it down - so do yourself a favor, do not put water within, unless you enjoy cleaning up spills.\n
 I bought this cat tree to replace an old, ratty, yet well-loved Armarkat. I also wanted something that wasn\'t as wide. I had read reviews of cat trees similar to this one that described them as being difficult for cats to climb and descend, because the platforms weren\'t large enough. Unfortunately this tree has the same issue. I put my cat on the top platform, and he couldn\'t get down! He was only able to put his front paws down on the next step. He ended up jumping off the top. (I felt terrible).</></>I really like the look of this tree, and I knew I wouldn\'t return it, so I drilled new holes in the smaller platforms and reattached them. Now they extend far enough past the platforms above so my cat can get down safely.\n
 I\'ve been avoiding having a cat tower for AGES - most of the ones out there wrapped in faic I found to be hideous and hard to pair with the rest of the house. That being said, my cat LOVES being up high, so I was so glad to finally find this cat tower in all my searching. My favorite things about it:</></>1) It\'s really tall! At first I thought it was going to be TOO high, but after about a week, my cat now lives up there most days (especially since putting it directly by our window for him to see out of;</></>2) It is incredibly sturdy! It took some time to put it together (about 20 to 30 minutes) and I was surprised at how hefty it was after coming together. I really appreciated this, considering how tall it is, as I was afraid of it might be unstable. My cat is about 12 pounds for reference, and he fits comfortably on each level, with no issues jumping up/down.</></>3) The connecting arms between each level are also scratching posts and my cat loves kneading these.</></>4) Not that my cat cares about this part, but I really like the neutral colors, and how it isn\'t a complete eyesore. I ended up not using the green faux leaves that come with it, as it looked kind of cheesy, and we have plenty of real plants in the room.</></>Overall, highly recommend this if you\'re also searching for a cat tower you don\'t hate looking at every day, ha!\n
 First if all I want to say my indoor cats really love one side of the tree. They don\'t go on the other side, probably because it isn\'t in front of the window. My biggest complaint is it is so incredibly hard to put together because the pieces are not labeled and the directions do not tell you which side faces up or down. For such a quality product, you\'d think they could help the consumer out a bit more with directions. I had to disassemble pieces about 5 times total because something wasn\'t put on correctly. The directions are so poor I\'m going to give it 3 stars. This thing took me 3.5 hour to put together. It should have taken 45 minutes but you have to measure everything to know if it\'s the right piece. If I\'m spending this much on a disassembled cat tree, the directions need to be much clearer.</></>I ordered the F2097\n
 I didn\'t think when I put this thing together that it would be so big, but I\'m pretty pleased my cats will have a place to run up and down on. Currently, my oldest cat is cool with it, but my other cat is absolutely terrified and won\'t go near it. Hopefully she will warm up to it. The only reason I\'m giving it 4 stars is simply because I think they should mark the letters on the parts to better help with building. Not only that, but it would help if it said which parts to build first. Example: attach the little house first before the legs. I put the legs on first.\n
 This thing is a behemoth. My 10-month old kitten is loving it, and I got it with the intention of adopting another kitty.</></>Now for the scary part: I walked in on my kitten with his head caught between the hamper strings, being strangled. It was wound really tightly around his neck and I had to quickly untwist it to get him loose, no scissors at hand. Thank goodness I was at home! My solution was to tie the ropes extremely close to the polls and leave no hanging room. That seems to have worked; the alternative was to remove the hammock altogether.</></>For that reason, I can\'t give many stars to this product. It may have just been an accident, but I want others to be aware.\n
 I really like this condo.</></>I have had some of the more popular ones with the three little seats supported by one stick.... They always start wobbling and falling off. So when I picked this one, I was looking for support.</></>2-4 legs on each platform gives a lot of support for my hyper cats!</></>They love climbing up the poles. They go through the tunnels. (One of my cats is on the large side, so the tunnels are large enough for him). They like sitting on the little stand at the bottom that only has one support pole. What\'s nice about it is it\'s short-- so it seems like it will be a little more sturdy.</></>Setup wasn\'t bad. They include all the tools you need for success. I had a few dud holes for the poles. By dud, I mean I screwed them in and then they just fell down about an inch. This meant that I was unable to screw the next pole in successfully. I just unscrewed it a bit and that seemed to work fine.</></>I have this against a wall in a corner. I don\'t really think it would do so well if it weren\'t wedged in. before I had it in the corner, it seemed to wobble a little when my cats got super hyper. From my experience, that will only get worse with time.</></>It\'s sturdier than my previously owned cat trees. My cats love it. Don\'t buy this one for the leaves!\n
 Go Pet Club, I love this tree, really I do. It&# ;s large, lots of room for my two cats, and very stable. Why, oh why, do you not label your parts? I had to measure each piece to determine which was which, except for the metalware (which were bagged separately, thanks for that). Also the hooks provided for the hanging bucket shelf are too small. And while the diagram provided as instructions was accurate, why not make it larger so this crazy old cat lady could see it more easily? Some little sticky labels on each piece a la IKEA would have been most helpful. My husband and I, after battling the construction, decided to do without the low-quality greenery, and we chose not to use the thick rope piece.</>Be forewarned, buyer, have patience. Your hard work is worth the effort. Put together, this tree is great.\n
 This is the best cat tree we have ever owned. We had a few before but they always were bare within a month and on down the road a bit the got wobbly. We tried to tighten them but it never stays.</>Then we decided we needed a new one and our cats were spoiled by the hammocks so it had to have at least two. Everywhere we looked we saw one hammock it two but it was really short and we also found tall but no hammocks. .  . . Until we found this one. This cat tree has everything we wanted for our cats. Hammocks, tall, stuff to play with. It has everything! It\'s also very sturdy which is great because our cats run up and down it at lightning speeds all the time. It may cost more than a regular cat tree but it is absolutely worth it.\n
 I have only had this product for a few months!!  We bought it for our 5 cats!  They are an active bunch!!  Well we put it up at the end of June and it\'s already oken in two places!!!  My baby who is barely a year old just fell off and scared her too death!!  Now my cats have no where to jump down from when they are up on top!!  I want a REFUND on the amount of money I paid for this product!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!\n
 This cat tree far exceeded my expectations! I would buy it again in a heart beat.</></>Pros:</>Fairly easy to assemble</>Looks great in my apartment</>Cats loved it immediately</>The faic is very soft</>Lots of scratching posts</>Tree is sturdy. So my cats are able to take full advantage of the scratching posts</>The hammock is surprisingly big (I thought it would be too small but it is perfect)</></>Cons:</>Bolts need to be tightened occasionally to keep tree sturdy</>Scratching posts have all been destroyed (whether that is from excessive use or poor design, I\'m not sure)</>Faic has started to come off one of the platforms</>Mouse attached to top platform came off within an hour of assembling tree</>There is no place to attach the vines that come with the tree. So they ended up coming off fairly quickly.</></>The gopetclub website offers replacement parts if you contact customer service, but they are pretty expensive. It\'s almost better to buy a new tree if you need more than a couple parts.</></>Attached is a picture of right after I put the tree together and the other picture is about a year later.\n
 If this is the first time you\'ve put together a cat tree, it may be a bit of a challenge.  With a little patience, and a tape measure (the column pieces aren\'t labeled, but are all identified by length in the instructions, i.e. A is 11 1/2" , etc) it isn\'t too difficult to do.  For the height, the base is large and heavy enough for decent stability.  The description says it can handle larger cats, and weight isn\'t an issue, but I\'ve got a Norwegian Forest Cat that stands just under14" at the shoulder and he\'s a bit tall for some of the levels. I had to take out the swing section so he had room to climb.  Probably better for smaller cats, but sturdy enough to handle the weight of larger ones.\n
 Great quality for the price. I do have 3 small recommendations:</></>1. Be ready to measure all the upright posts as you assemble the tower. It\'s pretty straightforward, with a table that gives an approximate measurement in inches of each part needed, and the pieces fit together well. Just takes a little extra time to ensure you\'re using the right post. Arranging them by length at the beginning of this undertaking also helped a lot.</></>2. For those with messy pets like mine, you might want to elevate this tower off the ground a little. All the platforms, including the base, are made from particleboard that looks like it would puff up and start to rapidly disintegrate if it ever got wet. Even with the water bowls across the room, I could see my cats or derpy dog contriving a way to make this happen. X) I might paint a spare pallet and slide it under the tower just for a little extra peace of mind.</></>3. This isn\'t strictly necessary, but a staple gun made decorating with the vines MUCH easier, and now I feel like they\'ll actually have a chance of staying attached with a wily feline yanking on them.</></>Mitch the Ditch Kitten (now a spoiled house cat) was very eager to check this thing out and went right into the house as soon as I unboxed it. His favorite feature seems to be he embedded food bowl. I\'m definitely going to add some more vines and dangling toys to this tower as we go. Five stars! &#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#128568;\n
 We\'ve had this for 2 months now.  Very nice, but not perfect.  The first thing I want to mention is that the little mouse-on-the-string toy lasted WAY longer than I expected.  Our two cats (10 lb 1 year old, and 14 lb 4 year old) take any toy as a personal challenge to cause destruction.  The string held up for about a month, and even after it snapped, they continued to play with the little mouse (who was only slightly worse for wear with an ear off).  But, as for the tower itself, not particularly difficult to assemble, just took some time.  Husband spent maybe 2 hours on it.  The box was more than enough entertainment for the cats while he worked.</></>The construction is sturdy in that the pieces don\'t wobble after connecting them.  We had to place our tower on carpeting, so there is a bit of wobbling when the cats are both jumping around on the tower, but after a couple of times they stopped caring about that.  It\'s absolutely not going to tip over, so they just ignore it.  We did put some extra weight on the bottom just to be safe, but on a hard floor I don\'t think it would even be an issue.</></>The thing does collect fur, and the soft faic covering sheds a bit with use, but it\'s been 2 months with daily use and there are no real signs of wear that concern me.  It just needs to be vacuumed off every week or so.</></>Bottom line: our cats love it.  For playing and napping.  I think the base piece should be heavier for safety reasons, and I think there should be a way to replace the string-mouse, but I\'m still happy with the purchase.\n
 WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this cat tree!!</></>First of all, it came in two separate packages...both are EXTREMELY heavy. Once you open the boxes you will realize what you just got yourself into. There are seriously a billion pieces to this thing. Nothing comes labeled and it only comes with pictured instructions which is very confusing. In addition, I realized that a few of the pieces arrived oken so that was disappointing. Me and my boyfriend were in the middle of putting it together and two of the poles got completely stripped by the nuts inside. There was no other way of fixing it except to buy ackets and nail the poles on, so that\'s what I did. I finally finished putting the tree together and it looks great but seems very unstable...I have a total of 5 cats which is why I decided to get such a large cat tree. However, the two pouch-like beds are VERY SMALL and my cats do not fit inside them at all. This is upsetting because on the old tree I had, the pouches were their favorite. All in all, I like the tree. It has great colors and is very big, which is what I wanted. I just wish it was more stable and made for larger cats. I hope it doesn\'t eak while my cats are on it! Just be careful if you are thinking of buying this cat tree and you have large cats because it is not the best! Lastly, I think it is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for the quality. Having pieces arrive oken is unacceptable when you pay so much for something. Hope this review helps!!!\n
 **2 year update**</>Still 100% happy  with this purchase. My kitty is about 13 lbs and she runs and climbs to the top and it moves quite a bit but still stable and has never fallen. Some of the ropes are shredding from clawing but none are coming off yet. It still looks awesome!</></>I am VERY happy with this purchase! As I was putting it together my 2 kitties were already climbing all over it lol. The directions were pretty basic when putting it together and only had pictures, but the pictures explained it well enough. The only issue was the pieces were not labeled, but they were fairly easy to distinguish (lay all your pieces out and separate to start with to make it easier).</>I had a cat tower several years ago and it was huge! Large square base with multiple large square platforms above it and it took up a LOT of space! I like that this one has a smaller more oval base and the shelves are big enough for the kitties to lounge or climb but not so huge that they take up an enormous amount of space. I have 1 13 lb cat and a 2 lb kitten and as soon as it was done they were all over it and my 13 lb cat was all the way up on the top platform playing with the little toy attached and it wasn\'t wobbling at all.\n
 Well how do I start. As others have stated the directions are not the best but if you refer to the picture in Amazon and then try to make out the directions. Then the building is not too bad. I will post pictures so future customers can see better angles and where parts should go. All an all the tree is awesome and unlike others my cat who is roughly 18-20 Lbs has made it tot he top and not oken the tree. So it should do well with other husky cats. Yes I can attest that the house on the very top is meant for small cats although my husky cat was able to fit through the opening and come out through the other side without getting stuck. I would have given this 5 out 5 but the tree condo wood material are subpar. It uses some cheap type of particle wood that eaks easily. My condo arrived damaged in two corners. Although you cant see them as they are on the back of the first house on the bottom. So I was able to live with it. I would have used MDF its a littler stronger and would give it the much needed support for heavier cats. All in all its a good tree and my cats are loving it. I would suggest for peace of mind to attached a link between the far top left bed and ace it to the top house with some ort of link/rope/or something so it doesn\'t wobble as much. Again this is more if you want peace of mind. its not needed but could give you relieve in case you have a heavy kitty who is a daredevil :)\n
 nice cat tower, looks good in living room with dark furniture.</>my cats are picky and pretty much all of them only like one certain tower (the pet club leopard print one) and they rarely use the extra new ones we get but, all of them actually like this one. it meets the need of my strecth and scratch cats and of those that like to lounge up high....and this tower is very high for them indeed. not super wide, yet very sturdy. cats rarely used the houses/condos on their other cat towers but, they seem to like the one at bottom of this tower. the vines are a nice touch but, get in the way of cats that want to scratch poles so we ended up taking them off after we had put them on and put them only around top four poles under house instead.</></>my only major complaint is the bowl, it does not fit snuggly into hole and has about a 1/4" gap around under rim so it wobbles, it is basically too big to go into hole that was made for it. a minor complaint i have but, its a normal thing with most tower makers, is how the mouse is hung with an easy to chew off string with one bite or two within a minute! don\'t get why they cannot just use a thin wire like some cat toys have. either way, i automatically sliced up a thick straw length wise and covered up string with it and taped each end area so that mouse with survive hanging there for awhile or at least until the elastic string stretches too much and snaps off staple it is hung by..</></>in the end we are happy with tower and its looks. hubby who says i spend too much on the cats, actually said i should buy another one to replace the tower he built upstairs so that says something about how nice and good this cat tower is!!\n
 I bought this to keep 2 teenn age cats and one kitten occupied.  They love it!  It is a little on the big side which is good for the cats but takes up more of my family room than I want right now but I intend to rearrange the room soon.  In the meantime, it\'s very attractive and could almost be mistaken for furniture other than a cat tree.  The only drawback is the leafy vines that twist around the posts.  The leaves come off fairly easily and I have found them around the room.  The cats don\'t try to eat them but it\'s sad to see any tree lose its leaves.</>SincerelyFromMe\n
 I have disassembled and reassembled this cat tree for 3 apartments. It has survived my fat ass cat from kitten hood, (8 weeks old) to this day, as he is about to be 2. Beerus is a heavy boy, who still tears around the house like a 2lb kitten, except with an extra 12lbs. He will rocket launch himself up on this tree, fly up it in a dust cloud, and leap off from the middle platforms. I am honestly incredibly surprised it hasn\'t snapped. It\'s super tall which was amazing for his escape from my dog, he could stand on his back legs and reach 5ft up (German sheperd grey hounds, amirite?)</>the water bowl is a great addition, if your dog isn\'t capable of flipping it with his head. I ended up having to take it out (so the cat could smack the dog through the hole.)</>Point is, this thing is heckin\' durable. You might need to tighten the posts often, but its not hard. Assembly has become second nature because apparently I can\'t stop moving.</>The easiest way to clean it is with a pet vacuum. Does wonders.\n
 This thing is huge, with many pieces-NONE OF THEM LABLED. It comes with a sheet that gives dimensions and names for everything, but the pieces themselves are not labeled. I had to measure every piece before placing it. There is one sheet of nine steps. That means every &#8220;step&#8221; was actually 3 steps or more. The instructions were well drawn, but had a lot of information in tiny detail. For comparison, I put together cat furniture earlier the same day that was less than a forth of the size of this piece. It came with a booklet of 25 steps, each step on its own page.</></>When I got near the top of this monstrosity, one of the boards did not have the holes cut right. I had to hammer my own hole to get the screw through.</></>Between the poorly written instruction and lack of labels, this thing took way to long to assemble, but the finished product seems sturdy enough. The faic it is covered in is very soft, but not very sturdy. I&# ;m not sure how well it will hold up.</>Also, don&# ;t drape the plastic leaves like the pic shows. That&# ;s downright dangerous for your cat. I was surprised when it was actually included.\n
 I bought this cat tree almost a year ago, and despite some of the negative reviews, it arrived in perfect condition, the vines were present and perfect, I had no problems assembling it by myself, and I found the instructions easy to follow. It is heavy, so make sure you assemble it in the spot you want it. I do agree that the scratching posts should have been made to be on the bottom, and my cats do not use them, as there is not enough space on that level for them to be able to use the scratching posts, but they have plenty of other posts on one of their other cat trees that they have shredded, so not a big deal to me. I also attached a variety of cat toys all over this tree to make it even more interesting, and had a lot of fun doing so. I do suggest that you attach the "hanging idge" to the lowest rungs, and not the second ones up. You can see the difference between the product picture and my pictures. Your cat will not be able to use the idge for lounging if you attach it to the higher rungs. Hanging from the lower rungs, the edges of the idge will be flush with the ledges on either side, and also provide more support for the cat\'s weight.</></>I have 2 cats. A large female weighing over 13 pounds, and a small male weighing 8 pounds. This cat tree was a great addition to my cats\' in-house playground, as you can see in the pictures, and has remained sturdy. Both of my cats enjoy this tree, but they each have chosen their favorite over time. My black male spends the most time on this tree and has not lost interest over the almost 1 year I\'ve had it. My tabby female prefers the leopard print tree, which you can also see in one of my pictures.\n
 I am obsessed with big, tall cat trees and had been wanting this one for a long time but the price was always way too high. I finally saw it for the best price and now it&# ;s mine (and my cats&# ; :)!</></>I&# ;ve put a lot of cat trees together and found this one to be no more challenging than the others. It&# ;s big! So it took me a bit longer to put together than my last 78&#8221; cat tree. None of the cat trees I&# ;ve put together ever had anything but the photo diagrams and measurements but that&# ;s all I needed along with a chair to stand on and measuring tape! It&# ;s great if you have help, but I&#8216;m female, 5&# ; 3&#8221; 130lbs and put this baby together all by myself so you can do this! The base and the hammocks were probably the most challenging parts but I got it done. The tree came in two boxes with no parts missing..everything was in good condition. I used a spare metal washer I had for the highest basket for extra stability and walla! I really like the amount of sisal rope for the cats to scratch on. And it just looks good! I enjoy the colors and the material is very soft. I discarded the faux greenery.</></>It&# ;s very big, heavy and sturdy. I have 3 adult cats (all between 11 and 13lbs) and this tree serves all of them well. You can see all of them chilling on it in my photos. My main girl cat loves the baskets. And while these baskets seemed to be pretty shallow, she amazingly &amp; comfortably fits in them at 11lbs as you can see. She loves them!</></>I&# ;m very pleased with this tree all the way around. Highly recommended.\n
 Would not recommend if you have multiple cats and/or big cats. I have 8 cats and was hoping this would be perfect for them. Bought the cat tree April of last year. In Dec the left perch oke while my cats were on it! I was in total shock, my cats are fine thank goodness. For the price I expected it to be a lot stronger. The column pieces are made with hollow cardboard tubes. The twine on them doesn\'t last long either, exposing the cardboard. One of the hammocks in the center has a rip in it at some point I will need to make a new hammock. The carpet on the center section is also falling apart. I will probably buy new twine to replace it.  Still trying to figure out how to add structure support for the right side of the cat tree. If and when I do buy a new cat tree I will make sure it\'s made with wood, not this hollow cardboard crap.\n
 We purchased the F2096 model and it arrived in eight days.</>Omitting the hammock gave my cat more space on the platform directly below it and now hangs there.  She tried the hammock and quickly darted off it.  Moving platforms are a definite and HARD NO.</></>The upper cylinder has an entry from the top and the front,  insufficient climbing walking space around the front and the cylinder wobbles a bit, so that portion isn\'t likable, and the screws which hold that upper cylinder in place are VERY short and difficult to align  Recommendation for access holes on both sides to the climbing sisal beams in addition to the front and top holes would be much better for play and lounge access.</></>Wishing the two sets of lower supports had the sisal material and not the carpet like that thrid tier supports sets do.</></>Otherwise, a good, sturdy and very pretty addition to our space, and the price is right.\n
 If you are considering buying this product, please read my review carefully. I don\'t usually write reviews unless it is really really bad and I have to warn people. First off, the ease of assembly and structure quality is not bad. Besides a couple of posts that could not be tightened, everything else seemed to be fine. However, my 3-month old kitten climbed to the top and tried to come down, he had tremendous trouble with it. It is due to the poor design of the circular beige step platforms being right underneath the own polygon platforms that do not allow enough landing space for the cat to come down.  My kitten went down twice but fell both times because he actually needed to dump down literally vertically and his butt went off the platforms has he jumped and caused him falling twice. After that, he was scared to come down every time he got up there. I was going to return this but the only way to return this for free is to physically drop it off at Amazon Hub which is 20 miles away from me. Otherwise, it will cost me nearly $30 to return this via UPS or USPS. It is ridiculous. So I ended up keeping it but had my husband modify the design by cutting off a third of the own polygon platforms to allow enough landing space on the beige platforms for my cat to jump down. Please see the photos of the modifications we did. Also, the included vine is also hazardous to cats.  My kitten was able to chew it apart in no time and the leaves oke apart from vines very easily. I don\'t want my kitten to swallow any of it so I took the vine down and threw it away. In summary, I do not recommend this item at all. If it was easy and free for me to return, I would. This is not a safe structure for cats to climb unless you plan to do the modification as we did.\n
 I did a lot of research into cat trees before I purchased one. I looked online at different stores and at different types on Amazon, along with also looking in Pet stores in bigger cities. Anything I found of this size was hundreds of dollars more than this one. I was nervous, but if I was going to save that much money if this one worked out, then it was worth a shot. I am so lucky I took a chance because my cat loves this tree. It is very big and he especially likes to climb to the top and sleep up there during the day. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because of the hammock. It was a bit small and in an awkward spot. My cat never used it so after a few weeks I just ended up taking it off and my cat prefers it like that because it gives him more room to climb on it. Overall, without the hammock, this would have been perfect. The hole on the front is rarely used, but sometimes my cat will squeeze in there and hide just for fun, but it doesn\'t get too much use overall. However, he loves the ropes and scratching posts. I tied some toys on it so they dangle and he plays with those as well. He even loved the leaves, which I thought were cheesy at first, but I\'m glad I put them on. I would really recommend buying this for your fur babies if you don\'t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars. This was one of the cheapest options I found that appeared to be a quality product and I was right. It\'s extremely sturdy and I haven\'t had any issues with it.\n
 If Chinese puzzles frustrate you then don\'t buy this cat tree, but if you are handy and are willing to make a few modifications your cat(s) will love you. A tape measure will speed assembly up tremendously. The instructions were converted from centimeters to inches so 24.8&#8221; means about 24-3/4&#8221;, etc.. The pieces are not marked. It took about two hours from opening the box to completions. Our cat helped from start to finish. The top house has some shipping damage. The floor had pulled away and the nails were exposed and one leg of the house was cracked. My wife and her cat refused to let me put it back in the box. My wife contacted the manufacture and after providing photo evidence of the damage and purchase verification they said they would send a replacement part for free. Not wanting to wait for the new part to arrive I solved the problem by removing the floor and removing the exposed nails. I noticed the top house fit better without the floor so I didn\'t reinstall it. With the screw no longer needed for the floor I drilled a hole in the top platform and used the floor screw to secure it to the top scratching post. I nailed the back side that hung down to the top platform. I think this is how it was designed in the first place and the floor was added for shipping strength. I used the floor to create another platform on the left hand scratching post. The bottom house fastening screws were protruding threw the floor so I removed them and put in a couple short screws. The top of the tree was a little wobbly so I placed four screws threw the bottom house into the poles at each corner, one screw per post, much more stable now. The left tower seems a little shaky and I will add a ace in the future.</></>***We received the replacement part about a week later.\n
 Shipping was quick, assembly was easy, but the center box is very small.  Without mounting it to a wall or ceiling, the top can be a little shaky, which scares our oldest cat (8 years old, 14 lbs.) He won\'t go above the first tier. Our middle cat is part Siamese (tall, slender 5 years old, 11 lbs.) He\'s tried to get comfortable inside the square/box, but he\'s way too big to fit comfortably. *Also both of these cats were declawed, so maneuvering is a bit difficult for them.  Our youngest (1 year, 12 lbs.) still has his claws and he LOVES it! He claws and climbs and jumps from level to level, and it is a GREAT saving grace for our furniture! To reinforce the behavior, I\'ve sprayed catnip several days all over the tree, and a all natural deterrent our furniture.\n
 + Looks better than any cat tree thing I\'ve ever seen</>+ Super soft</>+ Really easy to put together</>+ My cat loves it!</></>- Appears to be made mostly of thick cardboard</>- FLIMSY, like REALLY flimsy everywhere above 50 inches (it is 72)</>- Mine came damaged</>- It shed a noticeable amount while putting it together but hasn\'t much since</></>Overall, I think I would buy this product again...you know, in 5 years which is what I would think the average cat tower should last.  If it doesn\'t last that long I wouldn\'t touch this and again.  I need more time with it before I\'d safely and seriously recommend it.  However, so far it seems like a solid purchase in comparison to other cat activity towers/trees.</></>---</></>I bought this mostly based on a height to price ratio with the looks sealing the deal.  It\'s a great price for the ratio.  I expected it to be a touch thin or something to make that price happen, though I wasn\'t expecting it to be THIS thin and flimsy.</></>It is mostly made of CARDBOARD.  Not pressboard and not particle board.  It\'s just thick cardboard.  If I hadn\'t received mine damaged to the point that I could see the material in a shredded state, I don\'t think I would have known.  It\'s sub-Ikea grade stuff, like the back piece on furniture such as bookshelves, TV/DVD cabinets, etc.  The fur-like covering on almost 90% of the contraption was shedding off in bits and clumps all throughout putting it together.  There are still no visible bald spots (a week in) though there is a bit of fuzz appearing randomly on the floor...it could just be loose, extra material from production.</></>When my cat is on the topmost perch and the level directly below it, the tree shakes violently.  The entire thing is a bit wobbly (perhaps the bottom piece is uneven?) but it seems to be acceptable to her aside from the very top.  We\'re renting so we\'re still ainstorming on how to neatly and discreetly anchor it to the wall because it absolutely needs it.</></>Basically, if I had a really fat cat or 2+ cats that liked to roughhouse, I wouldn\'t trust this tree at all.  A fat cat would likely snap the sleepy bowl bed at the least.  Without stabilization, 2+ cats would probably topple it within a day.  When my cat did a full leap from it (after being scared from the wobbling), the tree smacked back into the wall...and she\'s like 4 months old and pretty thin...so yeah.</></>Putting it together was really easy.  It\'s only like a 5 step thing.  The instruction paper labels the parts but the only parts actually labeled are the screws which are in labeled bags.  That\'s really appreciated.  Fortunately, the paper has a color gradient so the \'fur\' poles are darker than the scratch post poles.  Out of all the things I\'ve ever had to put together, I\'d say this one wins.  Considering I still have a stupid evil workout system in my garage that is trying to strangle me with it\'s stupid pully system I can\'t figure out...yeah, I really enjoyed putting this cat tower together.  Haha.</></>At Pet Supermarket, I had seen these $200, 4 foot cat \'trees\' covered in trashy apartment carpet so I was really looking forward to the \'furry\' feel of this one. It is so super soft!  It has a beautiful sheen, too.  The colors are deep and rich.  It looks like a really high-end product and not like a roll of dirty carpet as I\'ve found everywhere else.</></>I think with a few modifications we can do at home (probably under 10 bucks) we can get this tree stable and keep it going for a few years.\n
 It\'s very large, as sturdy as other models of this quality, and once you get past the baseboard, it\'s easy to assemble. It took me about 2 hours just to assemble the baseboard because the images are confusing. They picture both the top side and the under side layouts. The illustrations of all the large platforms with holes are also confusing. Take the instructions advice, as well as other reviewers, and label all the pieces prior to assembly. Even then, I still confused two platforms but I figured the mistake out prior to going any further. If I can figure it out, anyone can.</></>My only complaint is that there are four screws intended to keep the hammocks secure to the posts and they are not long enough, they do not fit properly. However, this is easy to hack. I\'m not savvy with tools and don\'t have funky supplies laying around so I used BIC pens in the meantime. It seems to be stable enough. My obese cat walked across one of the hammocks and the pens didn\'t crack. My average sized male cat (12 lbs.) slept in one of the hammocks more than once and he was fine.</></>I will comment in regards to one reviewer who said her large cat fell off the top basket because the post oke. It is true, this post (and the basket beneath it) is not connected to anything, making it very unstable for hefty cats. It is unfortunate this was not designed more safely. Make no mistake, it IS a safety concern. However, if you\'re handy with hacks you could easily attach it by tethering it to a screw in the wall. Even so, if a hefty cat attempts to lay in any of the baskets, I have a feeling the baskets would eventually crack off, regardless of how secure they are to anything.</></>The condo at the base of the tree is HUGE. There is adequate space on top of it and to the left of it, for beds or smaller pieces of cat furniture, which is good for space saving in smaller apartments like mine.</></>Despite the design flaws (all cat trees have them because they\'re probably designed by people without cats), this is a good investment for a household with 1 cat or a household with 1+ cats.</></>* When this product was first delivered to me, there was only one box. I called UPS and they referred me to Amazon. Amazon sent me a replacement tree free of charge (all I had to do was send the first delivered box back through UPS otherwise they would have charged me for two trees). I\'m not the only one who had problems with this item\'s delivery. Best of luck to everyone who orders this cat tree in the future.\n
 So, to start, I\'m refining my screened in \'catio\' to make it more cat and human friendly. They\'ve already got one post from this maker and, if you can keep one alive in the FL humidity, I knew this one would survive equally well. I knew going in the base would be a chore to put together and I was not disappointed. You really need about 12 hands to hold both pieces together and get those 5 \'rods\' in and screw them in. Once done, it\'s a eeze. Once you get that base together it\'s easy to put the rest together. My cats love it.  It possesses both form and function. I can see MY view and the cats can see the birds, butterflies and lizards. I will admit after sweating over it for an hour I wanted some immediate gratification, so I sprinkled it with catnip...lol. It\'s a nice, low profile, sturdy addition to the new catio.\n
 Very nice and attractive cat tree!</>Note, you have to assemble it, but it\'s very easy. Took me about 20 minutes and only requires a little allen wrench (which is supplied).</></>Things to note:</>All of the padded surfaces are not covered with carpet, they are covered with a thinner, much softer fur-like material that feels very luxurious, but it not as strong or padded as carpet. Hopefully your kitties will scratch the rope-covered posts and not the surfaces... they wouldn\'t last along against your panther\'s claws.</></>Unlike our previous tree, note that none of these surfaces have lips or guards. Some sleepy or otherwise uncoordinated felines could potentially rolls right off while sleeping or playing. Being that ours is set up on the landing at the top of the stairs, with a 15 foot drop to the living room below. This could potentially be disastrous, but hey, they\'ve all had a good run. Survival of the fittest I say. :) (Coincidentally, in all these years, I\'ve never seen any of our cats fall off a cat tree (at least not that they\'ve admitted to), but as I was assembling this new one, our smallest cat was watching intently from the top of the old tree, and in her curiosity of watching me assemble it, she rolled over and fell off the old tree backwards and dangled there until I rescued her. I hope this new tree does not induce such clumsiness.)</></>My only complaint is that the decorative garland does not have any \'official\' way to attach. It\'s basically just 4 strings of leaves and you\'ll have to figure out how to fasten them on - thumbtacks I presume. And of course, like any kid on Christmas day, the cats find the box and the garland even more interesting than the toy... but they do like it.</></>So, assuming all three cats live through the initial adjustment period, I will happily give this tree a high recommendation. And if they don\'t, I\'ll give it an even higher one.</></>Enjoy!\n
 ... though one cat is not very agile and has yet to understand that.  He makes me nervous because this is one tall tree (and our floors hardwood).  Still-- we are all enjoying it.  I do miss the old-school cat tree carpeting though-- cats love to dig their claws into that (and it helped as a grip if they started to slip).  This plush material is not the same (and isn\'t cushy like carpet either).  They must not care much though, because they are on and in it daily.</></>For the build, sort the pole lengths and mark them with a light-colored Sharpie (I used masking tape labels on the platform backs as well.)  My son and I were building together and without taking the time to sort and mark we could have been in even more chaos!  As it was, we each thought the other one had bolted down the top house and it ended up falling off when the kitty started to climb up it!  (Fortunately, kitty is fine)  BUT, learn from us!  Double-check!</> Hammocks here:  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076PLYY9G\n
 A friend said I should build my own cat tree, then showed me a video on YouTube of a VERY basic, boring, ugly cat tree.  The guy that made it said it only took him three and a half hours and $145.  I said "No, thank you!"  What a waste of time and money!</></>This is a beautiful cat tree with some great features.  It\'s VERY tall, covered in sisal all over and only took about 35 minutes to assemble.  The only criticism I have for this product is that -maybe- it would be a little better if the base were rectangular and not oval (though I\'ve had no problem with stability yet, and doubt I will) and the little mouse hanging from the topmost platform has been torn off (though that probably has more to do with my kittens than the actual product).  At any rate, elastic is inexpensive and readily available.</></>Ultimately, I settled on this particular model because (even though it cost some $20 more) I realized that I would be living with this particular piece of furniture for the next 15 years.  Remember, cat trees aren\'t just about what the cat needs - it\'s a long term commitment that will remind you that you were a little cheap and got something that clashed (or you didn\'t - good for you!).\n
 I\'ve had this in my wish list for a long time and I am so glad I finally gave in. I so much as put it out and I couldn\'t keep the furry fam off of it. It\'s fun for cats of all ages, eeds and... species I guess? XD</>It\'s extremely easy to assemble. Barely needed the instructions.</>The only tiny issue was there were no tips on how to attach the vines.  What I did was, before tightening the final pillars to the top-most platform I slipped the middle of the vines in up against the screw and then tightened it down.</>The way they hang is up to preference, in my opinion.</>I definitely suggest this elegant piece.\n
 Originally bought this as a 2013 Christmas present for my "kids": A 3-month old male kitten and an 11 year-old female who was trying to acclimate to the new addition to the family. They both loved this climbing tree and went crazy climbing all over it, racing up the sisal rope poles, jumping in the "hammocks", hiding in the house at the top or bottom, ripping at the fake ivy and sometimes going inside the lower house (mostly the older female to hide from the male; their both jet black.)</></>Assembly was pretty easy, although they are a few flaws I would recommend fixing in future versions. Some of the holes in the bottom were misaligned, which caused us to install the lower house backward. The cats didn\'t mind, but it means that the instructions were a little weird to follow since the sisal rope poles were in front instead of the back. In order to avoid having the upper house come out backward, too, we had to improvise a little by mirroring the instructions for the opposite side. No biggy--we got it done.</></>The pieces that connect the front poles to the back poles serve as supports for the hammocks. You would expect them to be bolted or screwed into the opposite side due to the holes in the pieces, but there are no bolts long enough to use for this purpose. We have lots of hardware, so we improvised, but it seems that longer bolts should have been included for this purpose.</></>The ivy doesn\'t really attach to anything--it just wraps around the poles. It looks cute, but the cats obviously rip it out every time they tug on it. I wedged it into the gaps between poles for a while, but finally ripped the ivy off after 3-4 weeks.</></>The mouse is attached to the highest platform with a string; that was torn off within two weeks.</></>The highest pole is my younger cat\'s favorite, but when he got past 10 pounds, it started to wobble dangerously and required daily adjustments. Just when we had decided that we should ace it with something, the connector inside oken and the cat came flying off the pole. Fortunately, he landed on his feet, like a cat is supposed to.</></>Rather than fixing the oken insert, we decided to shorten the pole, so the upper platform is now positioned where the "basket" below the mouse is shown in the picture. My cats still love it and climb all over it, but I\'m sad that my boy\'s favorite high climbing post is now shorter and not as challenging to scale (he loved that ...). Still, it\'s holding up 10 months later despite heavy use by two very active cats that both weigh more than 14 pounds. The female doesn\'t appear to enjoy scratching the sisal rope poles, but the younger male goes to town on them. There are plenty of things for even the finickiest cat to enjoy. The plush material has held up much better than I thought it would, given how much my cats love to shred things, but I think that\'s because they prefer rope and/or corrugated cardboard and have lots of toys and options for scratching. If they didn\'t have any other options, I\'m not so sure that the plush material would have held up--it looks nice, but certainly wouldn\'t hold up as well as carpet. It is very easy to clean, though, if you have cats who produce hairballs ...</></>From the cats\' enjoyment standpoint, this tower deserves 5 stars. Based on the design flaws and manufacturing and/or packaging mistakes, I felt that it shouldn\'t receive more than 3 stars since it is quite expensive and should have had key elements last longer than they did.\n
 This is awesome!. I have three cat trees and this is by far the best looking of the three. What I liked so much about this tree was that it wasn\'t the usual combination. You know...base, 4 posts, platform, four posts, condo 4 posts, condo, 4 posts.....you get the idea. No platform is the same and that was a HUGE help in putting it together. Every level is different and THAT is one of the best things about this tree. It has a more \'arty\' look to it and I really love the vines. I stapled them in 6 places with a staple gun....lol...I hope it holds up!!! The own/black color combination with the pale sisal rope posts is very attractive. As far as stability...like a rock. It is sturdy, easy to put together and great looking. So far the reaction from my cats has been positive. But they do love their trees, so I expected no less. If I could give it more than 5 stars...I would in a cold minute. One of the best purchases I have made! Absolutely terrific!\n
 I am being generous by giving this product 4 stars! The reason I am is because its just so pretty!! I have 3 ferrets and I purchased this for there room, yes they have there own room :) what made me frustrated with this product is the directions are  horrible!!!! I mean just miserable!! After some patients and a couple of days taking a eak my husband put it together but he was not happy about it!!! The other issue is the particle board they use under the carpet is thin and cheap the left bottom leg of the ladder arrived oken so we will just glue it, if I was using this for a cat I would be concerned that glue would not work and the weight of a full grown cat could be a concern but for my little ferrets it will be fine. I have caught them all snuggling up in the bottom house and they love the hammocks!!! As for ferret use we did have to purchase some clear tubes so they could get to the top and secured them, overall I love it because it unique and adorable.......for the price I would have excepted better quality material\n
 I have 4 Maine Coon Cats and they are rugged and big.  They are all under 3years old and hard on anything they jump on or climb.  They all love this cat tree the best.  They can climb, jump, sharpen claws and play on it.  I am thinking about purchasing a second one and putting them side by side.  Great, well made and durable.  I will definitely look at Go Pet Club stuff first because you get more than you pay for.\n
 After spending a lot of time looking at different cat trees and reading reviews I settled on this one by Go Pet Club. I didn\'t want to spend over $100, but I wanted something that was quality. This one had the most consistent reviews out of all the trees I looked at. At first look, the narrow design looked like it might be unstable and since I have carpet floors, this was a concern. I purchased this tree because it had everything I was looking for in a tree for a decent price. Two houses, two ropes, plenty of platforms, sisel all the way up the posts, and even a food bowl. The product arrived early which was a plus and the box was not damaged. The instructions were easy to read, but the pieces were not labeled. I used a tape measure to figure out which post was which so it wasn\'t a big deal. Assembly was quick and easy, maybe took me a half hour to put together. From the time I opened the box, my cat was all over this thing. The little mouse was being harassed as soon as I took it out of the box. This tree turned out to be extremely stable on my carpet floor and I\'m not worried about it falling over or have to weight it down. The little mouse on the top lasted maybe 10 minutes at the most before my cat ripped it off. I tired it back on by the tail and he ripped the body off in a matter of minutes. Not a big deal though because I didn\'t expect it to last long. All the platforms are made of wood instead of cardboard so it will be easy to staple toys to it. Everything is covered in a very plush material that feels very soft and comfortable. There was a slight smell, but that\'s to be expected from something that was manufactured and then thrown in a box to sit for god knows how long before someone buys it. All in all I would recommend this tree over the others. You cannot get something like this for the price at any pet store like Petco or Petsmart. My cat usually sleeps with me at night, but now he sleeps in the upper house. He loves it and I\'m sure he\'ll get plenty of years out of it.\n
 Great cat tree, super plush and soft. Plenty of play aspects on this tree as opposed to other cat trees that are just a bunch of shelves/resting areas. This has the ropes, swing and a spinning scratch post at the base. I&# ;m willing to bet you can add more toys of your choice to it easily. My one critique of this cat tree is it&# ;s sturdiness. For my cat it&# ;s perfect as I just have a 4 month old kitten. But, I would imagine if you have a larger sized cat maybe 15lb+ or just multiple larger sized high energy cats using this at the same time I&# ;d be a bit concerned. I think if they made the base piece thicker it may provide better stability in that situation.</></>Another note is I took down the fake vines not even 15 minutes after putting it together as my cat was completely shredding them up and it&# ;s a hazard as it&# ;s mainly plastic.\n
 First one arrived oken and exchanging it was a huge pain because it&# ;s so heavy but I&# ;m glad I did. Set up was easy, took me about half an hour. My younger cat (1.5 yrs, ~10lbs) loves curling up at the very top, or running around like a mad women attacking the attached mouse and ropes (in the middle of the night, naturally). My older cat (8 years, also ~10lbs) checked it out but wasn&# ;t too interested. It does shake a bit when Lily&# ;s climbing around but it doesn&# ;t bother her and doesn&# ;t seem like it&# ;s going to tip. I might secure it to the wall just in case. I didn&# ;t put the leaves on because they were both trying to eat them straight out of the box. One downside&#8212;the screws stick out on the bottom, so you would need to put something under it to prevent it from scratching hard floors.\n
 This cat tree is beautiful when put together but there are a few things that could be better.  The bolt on the bottom should be recessed to it does not scape on the floor and cause the tree to very slightly rock. I put a rubber mat under it to keep it from scratching my hardwood floors.  Of course the greenery doesn\'t stay on once the cats start playing and without it, it seems a little bare.  The other thing would be to make the shelve more padded with an edge around the top so cats can feel more secure. It would be easier to climb if the shelves were alternated a little farther out making it easier to get to the top but saying that, it is nice to have it compact enough to fit nicely in a corner.  I really love the tree but it just needs some tweeking.\n
 The cat tree is what I expected except for one small fact. It is just a bit small for my cats. If you have small cats or kittens, I am sure it would be fine. My cats are a little larger so when they get on it, they kind of struggle trying to get comfortable. As such, they don\'t use it as much as their old tree. Don\'t misunderstand, there is nothing wrong with the product, I wouldn\'t even consider it unusually small, it just doesn\'t seem to fit my cats.\n
 Love this cat tower, but more importantly, my cats love it, too!  They are always on it (it\'s a great location, at the front window) and enjoy all the heights available.  I was worried that they would be too heavy to fully enjoy all the levels, but they are surprisingly agile for being 12 pound cats and are able to get to the top seat easily.  I would highly recommend this as a stylish alternative to the more "boxy" cat towers out there.  The fake greenery lasted quite a few months, but I had to throw it all away recently as they were ripping the vines to pieces!  I will look for more eventually to replace it as it did give a nice splash of color (and toys for them) to the room.  If this oke tomorrow, I would buy another one in a minute.  Best money I have ever spent for our cats, hands down.\n
 I love this cat tree, very good quality for the price. I gave 4 stars because the instructions were very hard to follow which I had read from previous reviews so I already knew to expect that. It took me a total of 3 hours to put together, they do not label pieces but they do give the measurements of each piece so it was helpful to have a measuring tape when assembling. Followed directions step by step while looking at a picture of the cat tree. House on top was not nailed together all the way so I nailed it shut myself. Top platform, 2 of the screw holes did not line up with poles, but because top house is heavy enough, and 2 of the 4 screws are in, it is on there good enough. Cat tree is heavy once assembled, and pretty sturdy as well. My cats do not have front claws and they climb all over this well.\n
 This has to have been one of the easiest furniture-type items I have ever put together. I managed to get distracted at one point and put the upper poles on wrong (rotated the instruction image by 90 degrees clockwise in my head) and didn\'t notice until I was finished attaching the upper platform. Even undoing the wrong parts and redoing them properly, I still managed to put the whole thing together in about 35 minutes. Two people could probably tackle this in less than twenty. It looks nice (I didn\'t use the "vines" as my cats are chewers) and my cats adore it. Even my heavier cat (currently 14.5 lbs) regularly uses the higher side shelf to peer outside at the birds. Neither cat seems interested in the upper tube and I may end up removing that eventually as it has no structural necessity (I\'d recommend leaving the lower tube in place regardless, just cause it helps the cats get from the middle platform to the lower side shelf). I would definitely order this again and have already recommended it to everyone I know with cats, but no cat tree.\n
 I really wanted to give this a 3 but I\'m going to give it a 4. It\'s pretty sturdy but I\'m not sure I would let more than 2 cats play on it at once. My 7 month old kitty was jumping on it the minute I opened the box, so it took me about 45 minutes because I had to keep removing her from the tree. She\'s pretty energetic so of course she was able to rip the dangling mouse off about an hour after the tree was built.... I will say I think the image to real product is actually pretty accurate. Additionally, comment about the little half tunnel that sits above the hexagon house - the W1 screw is not long enough to reach the board and screw in (see image) so I\'m probably going to have to get a longer screw or find a better way to make sure its secure.\n
 This took three hours for me and my mother to put together, but it is much easier if you prepare first before. First of all read the directions and label each part with a gold or silver sharpie so you know when you were putting it together which is which. Other than that it&# ;s pretty straightforward if you label first! The boxes are 49 pounds and 78 pounds so hopefully your mail guy will put it in front of your door! My kitten loves it already after two days it is taller than me so above 5&# ;7 feet!\n
 It\'s nice, but much room for improvement. First of all there is no carpet on the tree at all. The velvety faic they have it wrapped in is extremely slick on the cat\'s paws. Second issue the second level to the top the two sides that stick out for them to jump to the very top and get down are very very small ledges and extremely hard for the cat to get down from the top level down to the side ledges. I ended up getting some  drawer liner , like what you would put under a rug from it slipping around on the wooden floor and wrapped The Ledges in it  for better grip to the cat . My cat is pretty small 6 - 8 lb and she has a hard time with it. Other than those two major issues it\'s a very nice sturdy tall cat tree\n
 I can easlily say I spent hours and hours over a month\'s time looking for a cat tree. Our cat is a little under a year old and weighs about 9lbs. He started to jump on things we didn\'t want him to so we knew we would have to get a cat tree eventually. So I was actively looking online and in pet stores. I knew i wanted to stay around $100.  The biggest thing for me was quality, functionality, and I was super picky on how it would look with all of our modern furniture. I settled on this one because of the price, the color matched our furninture in our second bedroom (I did not see any that accented the own w/ the black, which is a really nice touch), the wife said it had to have a hammock (this is where George sleeps the most, so she was right :), and the size (74" was easily a foot or two higher than what many other cat trees are going for at ther same price). The cat tree arrived in two days, everything was in good condition and no pieces were missing. Now thinking this was too good to be true I figured it would be a pain to put together. I have spent some time remodeling homes and have put my fair share of new furniture together, and I will say this was not only the easiest, it ACTUALLY made sense on how you put it together! Very Easy, and had it up in 20 min. George loves it, and we love it too! Not one bad thing to say about this product, seriously. Great Job, thank you!\n
 My Winky and BearBear took to this tree instantly.  They actually wanted to play on it before I could fully assemble it!  I thought Winky would be too big for the hammock, but that is his favorite spot.  He sleeps in there a lot!  They don\'t really use the little hut towards the bottom, but they LOVE the top shelf and the tube thing.  They also love the fake plants and play with that as well.  They wrestle for the top platform all the time.  Very happy.</>Cons:  I had to put heavy weight on the bottom since it\'s not stable enough on carpet.</>They didn\'t include any instructions on how to assemble, so I had to use the picture online to assemble, not too hard to figure out, but I expected instructions.  It\'s much easier with two people assembling.\n
 Really nice cat tree, super sturdy and nice for my fat cat. Building was hard, had to restart twice because the instructions are kind of vague. But once it&# ;s built it&# ;s very sturdy and feels dependable! Only issue I noticed is for tall cats, the hiding crevices are a bit small. My boy has to crouch and crawl low to fit in most of the spaces. Also, only 2 vines of ivy so I&# ;m going to buy more to aesthetically boost it, but besides that my cat loves it. Will update if anything goes wrong.\n
 I placed the order on Tuesday, August 4th, and received it by 11:00 a.m. Thursday, August 6th. The estimated delivery date was Wednesday August 12th...needless to say that I was very impressed by how quickly it arrived! It came with easy enough instructions and all of the required tools to put it together. I was able to assemble it in under half an hour, and it is quite sturdy. I have three cats ranging from 7-10 lbs., and with all three climbing it at once, it stayed put with little rocking. One of my furkids loved the mouse so much, that she chewed right through the thin elastic! This product is \'Cat Approved\', and I will be sure to order from this company again in the future.\n
 You will definitely need some patience when assembling this cat tree - the parts are not labeled but the dimensions do help you figure out what&# ;s what. While assembling I couldn&# ;t find two of the smaller posts and had a minor panic, but they were stuck inside the box! Make sure to look for all the pieces first and double check the box!</></>Once the tree was assembled, my cats immediately climbed to the top and found their special place! They seem to really love it!\n
 I really love this cat tree! I did a ton of research and ALMOST went with other products. I was looking for a tall cat tower with platforms and hiding spots and scratching posts. I found some similar ones that were even cheaper but every time I read the reviews they weren&# ;t that great. I read a review where someone recommended Go Pet Club towers and so I started looking and found this one. It was a median price to ones from other ands, but this one had excellent reviews so I took a chance. It came with all the pieces and screws. The reason I give it 4 stars is because we had a bit of trouble reading the directions. It&# ;s just pictures, and while it&# ;s fairly simple to see, we had to take the idge down twice because we put the arches the wrong way. The screws that go into to top tunnel are super short, and just barely fit in so it makes the top tunnel super wobbly. Hasn&# ;t fell yet, but my 12lb cat might eak it one day. I see other people saying the vines don&# ;t really attach, but on mine i included a pic of the holes at the end of one of them. The other side of the vine was solid and they went together perfect and then I just put some green floral tape around it to seal it. Worked for me. Hope that helps others! All in all, other than the short screw for the top tunnel I really love this and so does my cat! Worth the money for sure!\n
 This cat habitat has really paid for itself several times over. Our kitten LOVES it. As the photos show he was eager to help put it together, it is where we keep his food so our dogs don\'t eat it, and he loves perching up at the top and overlooking everything. Especially if it gives him a chance to tease the dogs. He likes to start playing with the dogs then go up there and watch them when he is finished because he knows they can\'t get him. The greenery is nice too, but we only put one strand up at a time because he likes to play with that too and tear it apart!!! There are ample scratching posts and thankfully that is all he uses to sharpen his claws. This is also much sturdier than I had thought it would be based on the price. It\'s a great price for what you get because some cruddy cat habitats can cost a fortune. Thankfully this is a great sturdy one that didn\'t cost an arm and a leg. I am sure this will last Archer for as many years as he will use it.\n
 Love this activity tree for my cat!  Was missing one piece but did get that right away.  Made some changes in the structure of the tree mainly due to height of ceiling but do use all pieces.  Very much like the two tone and especially the added silk green vine, love that!</>Did use a staple gun to hold the vine in place better, but used it on the poles with carpet not the poles that he uses to scratch [except one in the back].  He loves his activity corner in the TV area!  He has six levels, made him a mosh box with a chaise lounge on top.  This is right by a window which is his TV watching the birds.  Fit perfectly in an area that was open for use.  I literally spent hours on Amazon and other web sites searching for the right one for my cat.  This is made well, large heavy bolts, metal inserts in the legs for sturdy grip.  When assembled 74\'\' it does move a little at the top but that builds his core muscles.  The base is large it will not tip over.  So happy to have found this one!\n
 I had no problem assembling this though it helped to have the extra hands of a friend but the 2 of us 75 yrs old did a great job. I knew the leaves likely wouldn\'t last long and many did get battled off but enough remain that it still looks great. My kitten was only 3 months and she loved it. She is one almost a year and stopped playing with the leaves several months ago. It is not ment for a very large cat but is purrfict for my little Minuete/ munchkin. It is very sturdy but only if you tighten things very well\n
 I was super afraid it wouldn&# ;t be sturdy enough; I have a long 16lb orange tabby cat and an 8lb Siamese. My tabby likes to run up and down things like this, and while it&# ;s a little wobbly, as you can see from the pictures, neither care. My tabby has climbed all the way to the top to sit on the little circle cushion without issue, and they both enjoy sitting on it. It took me roughly 30min to put it together by myself.</></>The only downside was the metal bowl arrived a little warped on the lips, but it was nothing a hammer couldn&# ;t fix. There also isn&# ;t anywhere on the tree to secure the leaves, but as you can see in the pictures, I made it work.\n
 My cats have been using this for months and it\'s still in great condition. It looks nice and is easy to assemble. It doesn\'t sit flush against the corner, but doesnt stick out enough to notice. My cats like to take a running start before jumping and it will shake a little bit. If you have a cat who is super super hyperactive, I would keep an eye on it just in case. I\'ve had more rickety cat trees that havent come down, so this one doesnt bother me at all.  Other than that, my cats love it and sleep on it every day\n
 I received this last night and put it together right away. It went together in about 20 minutes (working at a leisurely pace), and the only tool needed is the allen wrench that comes with it. It is REALLY easy to assemble. The cats were already sitting in the bottom part before I even had the second tier attached. They love it. I like the faux fur covering on the platforms: much easier to wipe off than carpeting, and no little bits to fall off. The leaves are intriguing to the cats, and you can arrange them however you want to. It is very sturdy but still easy to move around.\n
 It&# ;s taken a while for my kitty to get to the top on his own because the platforms are a little awkward to navigate. He&# ;s an 11 lb cat. He loves the food dish and now spends most of his time on top of the little house. One big downfall on this is the pieces aren&# ;t labeled at all. I had to measure each pole, there are 10+ poles. And, I cut a hole in one of the platforms because I thought it was the base, it wasn&# ;t. With that being said, this thing is 100% worth the buy, the green leafs it comes with make it look great and my kitty loves that he can look over his kingdom.\n
 My cats love this tree! It is made out of wood, so it is heavy and sturdy. I have seen both my cats on it, and it did have a little wiggle, but not ever enough to tip it over. Very sturdy! My younger cat loves the hanging mouse on the top level and will play with that for a long time. The only reason I didn\'t give it a 5 is because the leaves that decorate the tree look great, but lasted about 3 days. My cats were dragging pieces of them around the house. So far about half of them were in smaller chunks of 3-4 leaves so I can\'t rehang them. Otherwise, a great toy for my cats!\n
 This was a great purchase! We have it in the front window of our family room, and from the street the greenery looks nice. The tree itself has been well tested from our smallest girl Holly at 5 lbs up to the big boy of the house Chewy who is 18 lbs, and is sturdy. Two of our cats like to play with the dangly leaves, and the "vines" do eak - but it\'s to be expected as they are rather thin. Fixing the vines is quick and inexpensive with a bit of florist\'s tape (green, so it blends in) to put them back together again. Overall we are super happy with this tree, and would buy it again.\n
 We bought this for my daughter\'s cat, who spends a lot of time in my daughter\'s room so she won\'t fight with the other cats. This cat tree is really nice because it offers a lot of perches and nap spots without taking up a ton of floor space. So far the cat really enjoys napping on it or looking out the window. It is a little wobbly when the cat jumps on or off but other than that it seems safe and secure. As other reviewers have mentioned, the different levels can be a bit tricky to get down from since they don\'t stick out very far, but the cat hasn\'t had too much trouble with it. If it was a serious enough problem I imagine we could easily drill new holes into the platforms to make them stick out further, but that hasn\'t been necessary so far.\n
 I cannot get it together, nor get it back apart! The screw stripped the plastic pole! I cannot do anything with this!</></>Edit: I had to pound the pole down and eak the threading unit inside the pole. With the top shelf secured, it provides decent stability for my 4 cats. Also, as another buyer mentioned, my Tabby has a hard time getting down from the top level. She stumbled and fell to the window-sill the first time getting down.</>It is very likely that I will not buy another Go Pet Club cat tree.\n
 We have  seven different style cat trees for our cats and TWO of them are this one! We LOVE how sturdy &amp; well-made this tree is and how much room the cats have to lay down! We didn\'t attach the tunnels and placed those around our house in different areas to hide treats in (for the cats to hunt).  We also didn\'t use the leaves because we figured they\'d just collect dust. We placed one cat tree next to a bookcase that has our china cabinet next to it and put the other tree on the other side of the china cabinet--now the cats can run up one tree go across the bookcase &amp; china cabinet and onto the other tree to get down safely! They love hanging out on them and chasing each other around!  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!\n
 My cats needed a new cat tree so the wife and I sat down and looked through Amazon to see what was available and this is what the chose to purchase. At first I just shook my head and thought that it was a little too much and would take up too much room in the room it is in. I was pleasantly surprised by it - it is tall however, but it is pretty narrow. I was also skeptical by the price of it compared to others that I have seen on here and at places like Petsmart and Petco. The quality of this tree is great. It came with all the necessary tools and pieces but however mine were not labeled (a,b,c,d, etc..) so when reading the instructions I had to pull up the picture and piece it together that way.. but that was not an issue. The tree is very sturdy, good materials and overall quality. I love the fact that my cats have to climb it a bit for their food!\n
 Oh my, you should buy this, because it is so awesome, and my kitten pretty much sleeps and plays and hides in this thing. I did not put any leaves on it, but it has many toys, and the water dish is alright, but my kitten tips it over, so I just removed it. She sleeps in the very top, and scratches it and runs up and down it. It is truly a kitten hotel. Just to let you know, my kitten is now over one, and not tiny, and she just loves it still. It holds her weight and she runs and jumps and has a blast with it. Very easy to put together, and does not tip over. Taller than I thought it would be. Very strong too.\n
 My cats love this cat condo however it is smaller &amp; more flimsy this any others I\'ve ever purchased &amp; it had a bad pole screw that I had to improvise on install - made me so mad I almost oke it putting it together.  Beware on the pole screws as they are smaller than normal so they are not easy to replace with the old types.\n
 I was impressed by this cat tree when I got it. It was very simple to put together. All of the pieces were there. My cats Phil and Lil are 12-lbs and play very aggressive. I was worried about a tree not being big enough for them to play on. Thankfully this tree is very sturdy with minimal wobbling (only wobbles when they are on the top hanging halfway off it it) It is pretty large as well and they have no problem fitting on any of the platforms. They even fit in the pouch-like bed just fine. It\'s Lillian\'s favorite spot. They love to hide in the bottom house and attack each other. The house was a lot bigger then I expected. My Jack Russel Terrier mix fits in just fine as you can see in the pictures and he weighs 22-lbs. Overall I was very happy with the quality and mobility my cats had to move around on it. Its been two weeks and everything is still in perfect condition besides the poor toy that hangs from the top. They easily pulled that off and the string was easily removed to avoid a choking hazard. I would recommend this tree to everyone I know. Its a great price for the quality. P.S. Hair vacuums off of the faux fur without any hassle.\n
 My cats were all over this before I even got all of the parts out of the box. Was hard to set up with them already playing with everything. But this tree was an instant hit, especially with my shy cat who was prone to anxiety. His eyes lit up when it was completed and has been sitting at the top playing for hours. It\'s like he\'s 5 years younger. That itself is worth it. My other cat loves it too, but he is not a big fan of heights.</></>The leaves are a cute addition, though the ones I got more resemble pot leaves than anything else. Not totally complaining, though. It\'s funny.</></>All in all, first impressions are a good one. I think I finally found something my more anxious cat can enjoy and get something out of, or at least have a place where he can get away from everyone else.\n
 Perfect for both my tiny little tiger tabby and my giant Norwegian Forest cats. The little cloth baskets on the left are the perfect size, while there\'s plenty of equal perching places for the two of them to have their own "space" on the thing. Plus the condo is bottom-heavy so that when my bigger cat throttles himself at it the condo is less likely to fall over.</></>I\'ve also received a ton of compliments on it from non-cat owners in regards to the design and aesthetics. The condo itself goes great with my decor and the green foliage frills give it that extra little touch that makes it look more like a decorative playground in the living room rather than JUST a cat condo. It actually looks like it belongs with the rest of the furniture.</></>The thing is VERY heavy. So it\'s best to build it where you plan on placing it because once it\'s there it\'s going to be a cumbersome pain in the neck trying to relocate it.\n
 I put this together in very little time. Our cat loves it! I am 5\' 3" and my husband is 6\'. This is taller than both of us and our cat loves how high it is. She plays and sleeps on it and it gives her a great escape from the kids. She scratches all the scratching posts also. It is very soft. If you have a huge cat it will wobble a tiny bit if they act rowdy or play rough. It is very sturdy. Well made. I stapled the leaves in a few places so they won\'t fall off.\n
 super happy i found this item. the cats like it alot i have 3 and 90% of the time at least  one is up there.  seems pretty sturdy so far i would have like a wall strap or something for me to feel better about it. but even with all my cats up there (12#,9#, and 8#) there has not been an issue, i am only filling the food dish half way just in case.  they LOVE the food dish up there though.. now the other two food dishes get used way less.  it was super easy to put together they provide the one tool you need to assemble it. it took about 25 minutes to do.  the leaves could looks a bit less plastic but i still like them.</></>overall i am very very happy with my purchase the cats like it and so do i. it was easy to assemble. it looks nicer than some other cat trees i have seen also. i am looking to order another one and i pretty sure i am going to stick with this and.\n
 We\'ve been through a few kitty towers and I like this one a lot for it\'s sleek look (we didn\'t hang those plastic leaves), plus it has plenty of lounging space for our three cats.  I would not recommend this one for kittens or older cats, because it\'s really tall, and because going from the 2nd highest to highest shelf requires a bit of complicated maneuvering.  Moreover, because of this, they sometimes have a hard time getting back down from the top and just decide to jump to the floor.  They have a great time playing on it though and their King of the Mountain battles are pretty epic.\n
 ************UPDATED REVIEW***********</>DO NOT BUY THIS CAT TOWER! THIS CAT TOWER IS HORRIBLY DESIGNED AND VERY DANGEROUS! DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME! When I got this tower, there was only one bad review but I should have listened to the person who gave the bad review. Everything and I mean everything that happened to their cat tower happened to me.</></>THE TOP LEFT HALF OF THE TOWER OKE OFF WITH MY SMALL CAT LAYING IN IT, HURTING MY CAT! The tower had been leaning for months, not even a month after I got it and I should have taken the pieces off months ago. Just yesterday, my very small cat Kurt was sitting in the top bowl and it completely snapped off. My cat fell and was limping for a while and has been too scared to use it since we fixed it and tied with rope to make sure it is sturdy. When it oke I noticed that the sisal post below the top basket is almost completely cardboard except for a small 1 inch plastic piece on the bottom and top (stapled into the cardboard) that you screw/turn to put the other pieces apart. My boyfriend crazy glued this one inch plastic piece into the bottom of the cardboard sisal post and screwed it back into the tower and tied the whole top half of the tower to the bottom part of the tower to keep it from leaning. Before my cat fell, the whole top half of the tower (the top cat bowl and the little cat bed above it) had been leaning for months like the leaning tower of Pisa and I had also tried tying it down to keep it straight and stable. This isn\'t the only faulty horrible design wrong with the tower.</></>THE TOWER IS HELD TOGETHER IN MANY PLACES BY DANGEROUS STAPLES!</>The entire tower is horribly made. The whole tower is pretty much held together by staples. The rim of the very top cat bed on the left side of the tower came of when I touched it and I noticed the whole thing was attached by staples! A lot of the other pieces are held in by staples and I\'ve had to remove some after they began coming out and posed a safety risk for my cats.</></>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY GO PET CLUB AND HORRIBLE CAT TOWER DESIGN!</>When I initially got the tower it came with everything but one piece. I contacted amazon who told me that I would have to take apart and send the whole tower again so instead I took a discount and ordered the missing piece from the manufacturer. I notified the manufacturer and they would not give me the piece for free since I bought it through amazon so I had to pay for it. Well I paid for the new sisal post and it came oken. I should have known then that this tower was horribly designed and a safety risk for my cats. I opened the box and when I went to put the sisal post on the tower it snapped in my hand. I noticed that the inside cardboard was completely soaked through (which was unnoticeable when touching the outside of the sisal post) and had to get the company to email me another replacement piece (for no extra charge). I am so thankful that this thing oke in my hands rather than when my cat was on it and get injured. If a sisal post eaks on you you\'ll notice that the entire thing is made out of CARDBOARD with one inch of plastic stapled in to the bottom and top (not through the whole sisal post to make it stable, which would be the smart safe way to make it) that you screw the other pieces into.</></>If you see the attached pictures, you can see how after my boyfriend glued the piece that oke (the sisal post below the top cat bowl) we decided to tie the rope/string/ribbon to hold up the leaning tower of pisa (from the sisal post below the top cat bowl to the very top cat bed) by tying the top half of the tower to the bottom of the tower to keep it form leaning and falling over.</></>I also have included a picture of one of my cats Kurt who always uses this bowl so you can see how small he is. He is not even a year old and the tower started leaning and fell over with him in it. He is very small and thin and he is not even a year old so this should not have even been a problem.</>***************Old Review***********************</>My cat loves this. She especially loves the bowls, the house on the top and the very top. I rarely saw her the first month we got this because she was always on it. My cat ripped off the mouse on the first day, so I would not expect that to last.</>Unfortunately, it came missing a piece. Since I had already started assembling it, amazon offered me a discount so I was able to purchase the missing piece on go pet club.\n
 Bought this for my son\'s apartment, so we needed a tree with a small footprint, and this seems to fit the bill. Assembly took approximately 10 minutes and son is happy with appearance of this tree. Steven is happy and it looks like there is still room for him as he grows (the perch on top is larger than he needs at this point).  Am thinking of getting one of these for my home now!\n
 It was easy to put together, only took me about 30 minutes after work. It\'s a teensy bit wobbly when my cat jumps on the highest perch, but not being anchored to the wall, there\'s no helping that. It is still very sturdy though. The faic hasn\'t torn and the sisal rope is attached well to the posts. The little house at the bottom isn\'t that useful; being so low, my cat doesn\'t really go in there because she can\'t see much, and she\'s at dog and kid level, so she can\'t relax. But my kitty is 11 months old and about 7-8 pounds and loves this tree. She loves to jump off the recliner and land right on the top posts, gripping it like a koala. She also loves to nap in the hammock and perch on the top platform to watch all of us. I looked into a lot of trees before choosing this one and I was nervous, but I am so glad I got it.\n
 Great tree. My cat loves it. She\'s had 4 others before so she\'s used to them. I come home and find her curled up in the basket. The half barrel is also a unique feature not found on many other trees. My cat does not use the "house" but if I put a padding in it she probably would. Also when I tap the 2nd highest platform she jumps onto it and comes to nose kiss me.</></>The leaves lasted about 5 minutes before they got shredded. If you really want to keep the "leafy" look I would suggest looking for some steel wire type leaves to replace them.</></>Location is key to whether or not your cat uses the tree often. If your cat still doesn\'t use it after a few days try moving it to a different room or different part of the room. Cats are real estate experts.\n
 I bought this a few months back for my two cats. I have an older cat tree that is less exciting, just the regular carpet. They liked that tree, until we received this tree. Now they don\'t pay any attention to the old tree. The building portion was a bit of a pain, as the directions are not all that clear and many pieces were not labelled, but I managed to get it together. Once I gave the "ok" for the cat\'s use, they loved it. It is nice and high, lots of interesting levels and comfy laying spots. The circular hammocks are a bit too small for my big Maine Coon-mix gal, but for my other, smaller possible Maine Coon-mix, it fits her well. I am really glad I got this for them, as they can\'t get enough of it!\n
 This thing is great! Both my cats love it! My one issue is that the hammock bowl is too small.. my cats are both female and they are not big cats. So it\'s sad that even they can\'t fit in the hammock. We bought this one partially because one of my cats loves to lay in hammocked blankets.. Also neither of my cats care for the hideaway box at the bottom... I thought my other cat would love it as she likes to be in boxes and hidden but no. Other than those issues, this tree is awesome! My cats love attacking the leaves, scratching the posts and climbing their way through it!\n
 My cats love this tree! It\'\'s really cute and I love the string of artificial leaves. It looks really high quality and has held up very well. I typically buy cat trees from the typical pet stores but they usually never last a year and the top tiers usually snap from my cat jumping on and off of the all day and since they are bigger cats. I waited to make my review until I got past our usual eaking point and it has held up better than any tree I\'ve bought! I am really impressed! I may have to re-wrap the sisal rope soon which is a compliment becuase I never had one last long enough to consider re-wrapping it.\n
 This is  a sturdy cat tree.  My 16lb and 13lb maine coons love it because there isno wobbling when they jump up.  Now they watch the sunrise from the top every morning.</></>I did put a 10lb weight on the base just to be sure it was stable. I put a cat bed on top of the weight.\n
 My husband is the constructor around here, but he was out of town when it arrived, so I decided to put it together. Was a bit tricky at first, but like I said, I am not the constructor here. I found it easier to put the base together upside down, then flipped it to finish off the rest. My cats immediately went to it, they just transitioned from indoor/outdoor cats to strictly indoors, and this was perfect to place next to the little window we have, so they can watch cat tv!\n
 The quality of the faic is slightly better than I expected. It went together fairly easily and quickly. It is sturdy for its size but it is also still very light considering the size of it. It is large but has a small footprint so it fits easily in the corner of my living room and doesn\'t get in the way of my other furniture. My cat has enjoyed this very much. She is always playing with the mouse at the top. Since she still has her claws she uses the posts to scratch on instead of my furniture! I have yet to see her use the little house or the hammock (they seem a waste - I have yet to get one of these cat trees that my cat would use the little houses/cubby holes) but she definitely sits and perches on the different levels. Definitely worth the price I paid for it.\n
 I got this for my cat, Sushi. I&# ;m pretty picky when it comes to buying things on the internet, so I spent about two months procrastinating buying one since I couldn&# ;t for sure decide. It had all the correct pieces, instructions were very easy, also came with an attachment to anchor it to the wall.</></>I don&# ;t have mine hooked onto my wall and it still stands tall even when the cat olympics of 2021 decides to start at midnight every night.</></>Overall, everything that I was looking for was in this item. She&# ;s happy and I&# ;m happy &#128513;\n
 Update 2: I&# ;ve had this over 3 years now and this still gets just as much use! This is honestly the best cat tree purchase I have ever made!!</></>Well I just got this set up and my little babe already loves it! I did not realize how big it actually was, I added a picture for reference, I am 5\'3.  I am really happy with my purchase and am excited to see my cat grow into it!</></>UPDATE: I&# ;ve had this product for over a year and a half now and my cat is still loving it (bottom of photo) and my boyfriends cat loves it too! My cat can still fit in the little lounge part too!\n
 This tree is fantastic!  It is well made and solid.  The sisal posts all the way up are a lot of fun for my cat and the greenery seems to add to her joy.  She sleeps and plays at all levels of it.  I was afraid it might be a novelty for her and that she might lose interest.  Not the case.  It is her new spot!  Doesn\'t look cheap at all, either.  Fits in nicely.  Add a little catnip and you have a winner!\n
 This tree is not built like most cat trees.  It is not carpeted, rather the material for the tree is for like a silky fur/felt material that is thin.  But by no means does that degrade the overall quality of the tree for the amount you pay for it.  The entire tree is very sturdy; each column screws in and remains very stable.  The platforms are not wobbly like the trees you can pick up pre-built at Petco since each section is screwed in tightly.  The topmost platform is a little shaky, but that is because this tree is considerably tall.  I wish my pictures could do justice for how tall this tree actually is in person (over 6 feet tall).  I am baffled that I found a cat tree with these features for only $100.  Every cat that I have owned never showed interest in hammock styled platforms for trees.  But my kitties chill on it like it ain\'t no thing.  I can\'t give a more positive review for this tree.  If you have room in your house, please invest in this tree.  Your fur babies will love it!\n
 I love it, cats love it, yes it has cardboard tubes, do not over tighten the posts when you build it and they\'ll last longer. It looks great in my woodland themed living room like it was meant to be there. Shakes a little when the cats jump up it. Has a big enough base that it\'s very stable even with the shaking while the cats climb it. The shelves and house are pressed board which helps make this tree more durable. We won\'t stress when the end caps eventually do eak on the top post, long into the future, because we made the piece on thingi verse to 3D print a new one. Just print it, and glue a new one in, boom, cat tower fixed, move on with life.\n
 I was very hopeful about this cat condo. I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews before purchasing.  Sounds like a lot of people love it. It is well made and not too difficult to put together just time consuming. The reason for the low rating is because my cats couldnt climb up the various levels. Its not that they are old or in bad shape, the shelves are almost directly on top of one another so there isnt room to jump or climb from one level to the other. Unfortunately I had to return it because of this.\n
 The leaves don&# ;t even try to look real but it does make the whole thing look less cat tree and more cute thing where the cat hangs out. I hated handling the scratching posts because they kept poking my hands in the most uncomfortable way. Easy to assemble and instructions were simple. Wobbles a tiny tiny bit when the cat jumps on it but overall has been stable. My cat weighs 11 lbs.\n
 Physically speaking, it\'s durable. However, I\'m disappointed in the structure. It is difficult for my cats to get in and out of the hideaway and the hammock and the only way they can get down is to jump from top landing. My previous tower was from Go Pet Club and was way easier for my cats to get up and down and had plenty of places for them to sleep. My cats have nowhere to sleep on this one. I should\'ve bought the same one I had. The hammock literally folds over on my cat when he tried to get in it and he ended up being scared of it. The hideaway is located dead center and they have been trying to get inside but can\'t figure out how to get in there. I really am disappointed in this one. I love Go Pet products but this one is not easy for cats to climb and come down. You can see in the picture, my cat can\'t even lay down on that platform. Nor fit through the bars on top, or get in the hideaway, or make it inside the top. I feel bad for my cats. And they are older so jumping all the way from the top platform is not good.\n
 I got this for my 8 month old indoor kitten (now cat) because I did not want him climbing on furniture. I had researched why cats climb on things and it is their instinct and nature to do so as they would climb trees outside. I decided  to get this so it would just have its own place to climb and not on my stuff. It has worked like a charm and all he scratches is this and climbs this.  I got him accustomed to it by putting treats on the levels and letting him climb to get them.\n
 Great perch, the height is perfect. Our cats love the water dish. It came with a cracked base but amazon took care of it. We have two 15+ lb cats and it seems pretty stable.\n
 My large house cat shakes the tree and seems to be uncomfortable getting from ledge to ledge so definitely not for big cats.</></>My ferrets love it tho! And it&# ;s super tall so I was able to add stuff to it like play tubes.</></>Was easy to assemble and came with all the pieces including the little wrench to tighten the skews with, and I love the added vines.\n
 Takes up less space then my last tree. It is not holding up very well. The ropes shed leaving a mess and they are eaking off after just a few months of being in place. I had the tree for a few months before putting it together, but is was stored inside the house so I can\'t see that attributing to the ittleness of the ropes. I loved it at first, but it\'s messy and probably isn\'t going to last long\n
 My two big cats love this thing. Great price for such a sturdy product and really easy to put together. I have no idea why other reviews complained at all, this is one of the sturdiest cat structures I\'ve come across. The wood is solid and they send you all the pieces you need to put the thing together, even the screw driver thing I can\'t remember the name of. I\'m a 26 year old woman with zero mechanical ability who put this thing together and this thing gets compliments on how great looking and sturdy it is from every cat owner who enters my house.\n
 Neat cat tree but when I opened it up to put it together I truly thought whatever worker put this together was playing a joke. The two bottom slats that are glued together were glued misaligned so badly that we had to redrill the holes for the screws. I actually chuckled out loud to my husband it was so ridiculous. That\'s why I took off two stars. The shipping was great, packaging as well. I love Amazon but quality control from the maker was crazy talk silly.\n
 Adopted a rescue cat and wanted a place for her to feel safe as well as give her some place to scratch and this was just what she needed!  We actually shopped at PetBlah and could only find a very small cat tree for the price of this.  I was actually a little skeptical because of the reasonable price and was pleasantly surprised.  The materials are very nice, it has some good heft to it (highly unlikely to tip) and was very easy to assemble.  Nicely done!  Obviously, the real test is if the cat likes it or not and she loves it!\n
 This is well made and my cats love it! It\'s a sturdy cat tree, although the toy mouse was ripped off within the first 24 hours. I reattached it and it has stayed put since then :) I thought my male cat would love the tube piece on the side, but he hasn\'t gone near it. And I thought my older female cat would love the hidey hole spot on bottom, but she has shown no interest at all. Nonetheless, they both enjoy laying on the flat platforms at various levels. And my (young) male cat does love to play with the mouse dangling off the top shelf. It\'s been a great addition for the money.\n
 First, I knew this wasn\'t a heavy duty cat tree from reviews I read, but the price was right for what you got.</></>It was fairly easy to build. It took about an hour. I wasn\'t able to complete the last tower since the kit was a bolt short. All of the hardware fell out of the plastic bag during shipment. Unfortunately, there was a hole in the bottom of the first box -- looked as though somebody dragged the box instead of carrying it. The first box is quite heavy, and yes, there is a second box. Anyway, the bolt must have fallen out of the hole.</></>I contacted Go Pet Club and they were happy to send me a replacement. Unfortunately, the bolt wasn\'t in the envelope I received-- there was a hole in it too! Go Pet Club sent me another bolt, which I did receive.</></>The particle board used in this cat tree is not very strong, but it should hold up for cat use. One of the steps to the upper house snapped in half as I pressed it into position. A little gorilla glue fix that. The posts are segmented and hollow with plastic caps at each end. They are attached using the aforementioned bolts. I tightened them as best I could but I was always fearful of stripping the threads.</></>The two cats pod and the two beds/flats are, in my opinion, are too small unless you have a munchkin. When one of my cats curls up in the top pod, the whole post assembly leans. Now this particular cat is a bit heavy, about 18 pounds so some sagging is to be expected. The hammocks are great.  The cats love them. Another of my cats now lives in the bottom house. The faux fur is rather thin and I expect that it will easily wear out.</></>So here\'s the bottom line.  I got what I expected, the cats love it, but I don\'t think it will stand the test of time, and then I\'ll have to get another cat tree/condo.\n
 I bought the tree as our new and old cat were not getting along very well, and this cat tree has done miracles. Our two cats are now hanging out together in the living room together and having so much fun on the tree. Even though I personally love this cat tree, it might not be for everyone, so here are some pros and cons:</></>Pros:</>+ Such great value for the price. You get never get such a large cat tree for this price in pet store.</>+ Our cats love the features of this tree. Only thing they haven&# ;t used much is the cubby on the bottom.</>+ Easy and fast to put together.</>+ Sturdy. Can be a tiny bit wobbly when cats are on top level, but have never been worried about it even possibly falling down.</></>Cons:</>- Not ideal for large cats. We have an 8 and 10lb cat, and our 10lb cat mostly uses this for playing as he is kinda big to sleep anywhere on the tree. Our 8lb cat loves sleeping on this, especially in the pouch.</>- Is larger then it looks, which I guess can be a pro or a con depending on your space. We had to put this on the middle of your living room as it didn&# ;t fit well in any corners.\n
 It really is not as impressive as this makes it sound. It was easy enough to put together even though its almost impossible to know which of the 7-8 different post lengths they are referring to in the instructions without pre-measuring each one and marking it. I would suggest stickers like part E or F or whatever on these to make it easier. Once together, its not the most stable thing ever. It will do for the price, but it will be replaced pretty quickly with something that can handle the rigors of two full grown cats.\n
 Excellent quality for the price.  My 13 week old litter mates immediately knew it was for them.  As I pulled pieces out of the box, they went crazy over the parts.  It took about 20 minutes to put together without human help.  I did get a lot of kitty "help" that made the process take longer.  As predicted, the hanging mouse at the top lasted about 30 seconds after it was discovered.  I suspect it\'s the first in a long line of toys I will staple onto this tree.  Even my 18+ year old is enjoying the platforms.  Don\'t even bother with the plastic vine that\'s included.  It\'s a choking hazard and looks tacky.\n
 I have 2 cats, one small kitten and one large 3 year old man cat. The kitten took to it right away as you would think. I was surprised that my large kitty took to it as fast as he did. He\'s about 14 lbs and a good 3 ft stretched out. He likes the tube and I\'ve even seen him in the box a couple times. I was afraid he\'d be too big for this like others have reviewed on other trees, but he fits everything. As far as steady goes it hasn\'t fallen over yet. The kitten now about 6-7 lbs shimmies up the side quickly which causes it to knock against the wall but I\'m sure my uneven floors don\'t help. The large cat has been on the top level before, unsure the first time, but he was pretty confident the next time he got up there. The kitten does lay in the basket and its so cute. Its probably her favorite spot.</></>Update:  2 years later, and another cat added and this thing is in pieces.  They loved every minute.  They all like the basket.  Even the big guy that doesn\'t really fit.  It\'s never fallen over despite the unlevel floors and how loose it got over time.  My husband wants to redo the sisal on it.  I\'m thinking that\'s not really going to turn out, but I\'ll give it a shot.\n
 My cats love this tree.  It is sturdy, only wobbles slightly when they are running up and down it.  My 12 pound cat has napped in the basket since the day we got it with our 6 month old kitten joining her sometimes.  Its a tight fit, but they don\'t mind.</></>The mouse at the top only lasted one night before they pulled it down, but it did last longer than any other dangling toy, so if your cats aren\'t hard on toys like mine are, it should be fine.</></>The greenery in the picture comes with the tree.  Looked really cute too until the terrors shredded them all over my living room.</></>I highly recommend this, it\'s fun watching the cats discovery all the hiding stops and levels, and they look adorable napping on it.\n
 Our kitten loves this cat tree. It arrived damaged in the packaging (one of the boards was split in a few places), otherwise it would be a 5*. Amazon was very accommodating in working with us for the damage, though. Once we reinforced the oken bit with some wood slats, it was really easy to assemble. Took probably 30 minutes.\n
 It&# ;s a beautiful piece and matches perfectly in the kid&# ;s room. Our kitties love it and slept/played on it right away. However, the cloth material sheds small pieces quite much. After having it for a few months I can still find new small shedding pieces laying around. Also after only a few days, we can find loose leaves from the ivy on the floor. We gathered them, and will use hot glue to put them back, but we do hope the original glue they used could be stronger and the cloth material wouldn&# ;t be shedding constantly.\n
 I should have read the details more closely.  It is almost impossible for kitties to get a grip when trying to climb the poles or jump from shelf to shelf (which are quite small)  The poles &amp; shelves, from what I can tell, are made of plastic so kitty can\'t use her claws to dig in to pull herself up.  This has discouraged them from playing much on it.  They do like the rope, I am considering buying some rope to cover the pole pieces that do not have rope so they can jump up and be able to grab a hold, they can not grab the poles that are covered in the carpet.  (the carpet is very soft and nice).  They do not use the little "cubby hole" it sits on a small round pedestal and is very wobbly.  I am thinking of ways I can alter this so they can use that part.  I have seen one kitty in the little half pipe, they like that.  Overall, it is just OK, easy to put together, they love the hammock, but only one kitty at a time will fit.  I wish the platforms were larger, and that the poles and platforms were make of a wood that the kitties can sink their claws into.\n
 I read that this was easy to assemble, and was very happy that it actually was; building things is not my family\'s strong suit. But the instructions were very clear. The tree itself? Perfect for our giant, bouncy, intensely curious cat. This tree definitely holds the weight of a 17-pound cat on its highest points with nary a wobble.</></>Update almost six months later: Still solid, and holds both a 17-pound cat and a 10-pound cat simultaneously!\n
 I have been buying cat trees for many years but this one has been the worst I have ever purchased.  I never did get the side cubby with the perch on the one side to be secure.  The cats have never been able to use it.  I had my son come by to reassemble and he found it was not possible.  Within a month the sisel started coming apart.  At this point it is ready for trash pickup.  I bought it for my living room window and it is a nightmare to see.  Also, the black color shows the cat fur constantly and needs to be vacuumed every day.  Definitely not at all what they claimed it to be on advertising.\n
 It\'s big and looks nice, however the Materials are poor quality. The legs are made out of cardboard, the rope is not attached very well and the carpet is thin felt. If you look at the photo, the bottom leg has been scratched to smithereens by one small cat in a few short months.\n
 This is my second Go Pet Club cat tree; the first was larger and connected to the ceiling. I lived that one; with four cats that lived in it; but after a few years of wear I wanted to replace it. I had to get something with the bucket seat...my cats LOVE the bucket seat...but not something quite as big. This has absolutely been perfect. Not only does the color match everything, it is sturdy and durable without attaching to the ceiling. The cats love it and so do I. Highly recommended for the price. (Just remember that if it gets a lot of wear it won\'t last forever; however, 3-4 years with 4 cats is more than worth it.)\n
 We got this as part of a basement remodel since the window is 59" up from the floor and our pets used to have a shorter cat tree in front of it and just jump up the cruddy old walls from it to look outside.</></>Since the walls are now nice and redone, we did not want them scraping up the paint as they went to get the "underside" view of the birds and squirrels they love to have.  This was the perfect height and based on the reviews and price we went ahead and snagged it.</></>Previous owners answered our only question about the leaves being optional (thanks again!), which is good because we weren\'t a huge fan of them.</></>Putting it together was a snap and it feels really sturdy when finished .  There is a bit of wobbling as the cats jump up on it (they don\'t approach it as a staircase of platforms; they go right for the penultimate platforms), but we\'re not worried about it tipping at all.  We added a small blanket on the windowsill draping down a bit to protect the wall a little bit (they sometimes want to "slide" down the wall to the platforms on the way down).</></>We\'re really happy with this piece of cat furniture; it does not look out of place at all in our room.\n
 Have only had this tree for a couple months but it is great. Both our cats love it. Our munchkin cat curls up in the little nest and sleeps there every day. They don\'t use the other sleeping area. The tree does wobble if they are at the top but that is to be expected due to how tall it is. It is less than a foot from the ceiling! The mouse toy came off before the tree was fully assembled but we put another toy in its place. The leaves also don\'t stay on but it would be easy to staple them in place if we wanted.\n
 Beloved by our two cats! We have one smaller cat that can curl up and sleep in the top house and a larger cat that can manage to lay around the top platform next to her. We did remove the tallest portion as it put that final little resting spot about 2 inches from our ceiling. It is sturdy and we haven\'t had any issues with it rocking around while they run up and down it. Was easy enough to put together and the chemical/manufacturing smell went away in a few days.\n
 I really love this! My kitten couldn&# ;t keep off of it when I was putting it together! I put her food and water bowls on the bottom and near her cat box to remind her to scratch on that and nothing else and so far so good! She loves it and it looks great compared to a normal cat scratcher I love the vines! Also sturdy and easy to assemble! The material is nice and soft too and it&# ;ll be easy to clean\n
 Really nice tree, cat loves it and it looks great. My issue is with the company. A piece was oken upon arrival, I still put the tree together hoping it wouldn\'t make much of a difference. Unfortunately it did. I contacted Go Pet Club\'s customer service, emailed them all the information they requested and never got a response. Multiple emails later and still nothing.\n
 I am sad to do this review. We purchased a tower from these guys that wasn\'t as big and it was great. This tower, was completely opposite. We followed to instructions carefully and completely, making sure everything was right and secure. However, within 2 weeks the round perches were so shaky we had to take them off, and the scratching posts were also. We have one cat, and the tower barely held up to her. Maybe it\'s too tall and not enough wide. Either way, we had to take both round perches off and the 2 other round ones. Also, the screws stripped out way too quickly. I would not recommend this tower. I haven\'t given up hope with Go Pet Club yet, as the first tower was great. Just never getting this one again.\n
 We used some wood glue to fix it....but for the price I\'d expect the product to arrive in perfect condition.  It was taller than I anticipated, my fault, should have measured. Otherwise it\'s really cool.  You arrange the green yourself....so.if you only like it for the leaves just go buy some fake ones and wrap up your current cat tower.\n
 This cat condo is fatastic!!! I have 8 crazy cats, that are rough with their toys, and so far this one has been quite durable. We have had it a month.  The mouse was ripped off the first night, but I expected that, and they are still enjoying  playing with it.  Our last cat condo (which is behind this one in the photo) had all 3 of the perches knocked off, so I was trying to find one that would last when I bought this one. They love playing peekaboo with each other through the platform with the hole, and there are plenty of fun sleeping spots that many cats can enjoy at the same time. And the basket has a cat in it probably 80% of the day. They adore it!\n
 This cat tree is the best (and biggest) one I\'ve ever owned. The leaves you have to add yourself, and they don\'t exactly give you enough in the box to make it look like the picture, but it looks fantastic with or without them. My cat weighs 11 pounds, and he\'s pretty long-legged, and he fits everywhere on this. He absolutely LOVES it. I\'ve taken to feeding him his treats in the bowl. We originally got this to give him a place away from our dog, but he just hangs out on it all day long. We put it by a window so he can survey the outside world, and he loves birdwatching from the third level. I love this tree.\n
 Pros: big sturdy tree. Lots of different things for my cats to play with. The price is worth it. If you are deciding to get a couple smaller trees versus this 1 giant tree, I think this price is well worth it</>Cons: the poor labeling of the pieces. I\'ve put together 3 other trees before and all had labeled each pieces with letters. This one did not. You have to use tape measurer to figure which piece the instructions are referring to. Also the instructions were black and white so was not sure which is which piece. Also the mouse was a great touch but it was very poorly attached. It was ripped off by my cat in a week.\n
 Great cat tree and easy to assemble although the instructions I received were a bit confusing. Ikea instructions are easier to understand. Even with that it only took myself and a friend about 20 minutes to set it up.</></>My 15 pound very active cat loves the tree. He\'s always climbing and scratching and using it to look out over our balcony. It can be a little wobbly when he\'s racing up it but not enough that I worry it will tip over. Overall it was a bit more than I wanted to spend but worth the price for how much enjoyment my feline gets out of it.\n
 There&# ;s nothing I dislike about this condo. I have had this for aprx 3 years. Peco sleeps in this hammock on a daily basis and uses the scratch poles for her clawing purpose. When one  pole is frayed she will move on to the next one. I recently bought another one exactly the same and replaced one of the poles and think the old pole I will refurbish so always have spares. While replacing the pole I noticed a small rip on the underside of hammock but no worries yet, is double lined. She loves her kitty condo!! Excellent purchase, so much that I bought it again. Well worth the money.\n
 Alot of mixed reviews about this so I was unsure about getting it but I desperately needed a new cat tree for the fuzzens.</>The directions are missing a few steps yes but having a little bit of common sense helps and it was pretty easy to figure out the last two steps to put it together.</>I have a ten pound black Persian and a seven pound bengal and both loved it right out of the box. There is slight wobble when they jump and play but that is to be expected. The base is very wide and much more sturdy than other tree houses I\'ve had, it can definitely support the height and the play of two cats. The upper left most post with the kitty guard tower on top does lean when one of them is on it but not severely.</>Other than that I\'m pretty happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone with playful fuzzes.\n
 I got the "F2092" model and it was very easy to assemble, there were no dangerous metal bits sticking out. It looks really pretty thanks to the fake leaves, so I\'m glad it isn\'t a complete eyesore in the living room like most cat trees. I got it for my cat\'s birthday and she\'s still getting used to it, but she\'s pretty small (born feral), so her weight is not an issue. If she were any larger, however, I\'d be worried about the base not being heavy enough to keep the tree grounded, so I can see why other buyers would be reluctant to purchase it. It\'s probably best for young/small cats like mine and kittens.\n
 I love this tree~ It went together great and my cats were playing in it as I put it together. The vines are a little cheap but you can find ways to wrap them to make them stick. Its really nice there are a variety of perches and hiding spots. The only reason I didn\'t rate this 5 stars is the base is a little smaller and lighter than I would like and can be a bit wobbly when there are multiple cats on it. Great value though and I would buy again.\n
 I was disappointed in this item. I had another Go Pet Club cat tree that lasted a long time. We had to get a new one because our movers smashed our old one to pieces. This tower was very wobbly, however, I doubt it would actually tip over. My one cat wouldn\'t go on it at all due to it being so shaky, my other cat went all the way to the top and didn\'t care. I think this would be ok for small cats (under 8lbs). The part to the left with the cubbie and rounded platform were so wiggly though. This could be avoided by having 2 poles under the cubbie and one under the rounded platform. It is basically held together by a small screw at the top of the rounded platform into the top black platform and the bottom pole is connected to the bottom platform. More poles/structure would make this actually a great cat tower. Also, this sissle rope was not the quality my other Go Pet Club tree was. It was coming apart after less than 2 weeks. I had to end up returning it due to the quality and structure.\n
 I really like the height for this tree. I couldn\'t figure out how to attach the leaves so I kind of just leave them crumpled on different layers of the tree for the cats to play with. It was easy to assemble and is pretty sturdy. I have a 20-pounder that decides to jump and climb the sides to get to the top, it\'ll tilt (he\'s heavy, it\'s to be expected) but it has never tipped over. Overall a nice addition for my cats.\n
 I truly love this tree! It\'s absolutely gorgeous and so simple to put together.  My cat absolutely loves this!  She is a 15 of tabby mask and I was afraid the tree would be wobbly,  it\'s a little bit but it is really sturdy if that makes sense. She has jumped on it out of it and really gone crazy and it\'s sturdy minus a few wiggles lol. But really this was a great product for the price and it looks amazing! It really sits well with the rest of the house.  Great product.\n
 This kitty tree is awesomeness! The kitties couldn&# ;t wait till it was finished so they helped try out every level as it was being built! Left off the hammock because of a new kitten in the house and the green leaves. But this has become the evening place to rough and tumble every day! They especially like the top round tube because of the holes they can play in, one on top and one in the tube, they get silly playing on this! Highly recommended! Awesomeness award for great kitty tree!\n
 My cat loves her tree. She&# ;s a fairly lazy 12 pound cat but has her moments of energy. This tree has everything i thought she would like (after lots of online searching) and 3 months in she is actually using the basket as her new hangout. Perfect exercise for a once outdoor , now rescued cat\n
 Overall: great cat tree for the price. I would give it 5 stars but the assembly took way longer than necessary due to the scratcher posts not being labeled. I don&# ;t expect the fake vines to last very long. Three leaves have already fallen off and get in the way of the functionality of the scratchers. I will probably end up making other uses for them. Otherwise, I&# ;m thoroughly impressed with the quality and sturdiness. (It&# ;s much taller than I expected it to be as well!!)\n
 I have 2 big cat trees inside my camper. Very durable both and same and. The one on the right is the cat tree of the product of review. Very easy and fun to build up by myself. My cats enjoy these trees. I do not clip my cats nail so they climb straight up very quickly and impressively and play chase running all over their circuit. However, it does wobble a little bit, but that\'s when they go crazy running, climbing, and jumping on it. I recommend.\n
 I love the way this looks once set up, it was a huge pain in the ass during the build and I would think having an extra set of hands is necessary but overall I\'m happy with my purchase!\n
 This cat condo is well priced for the product.  As always, Go Pet Club does a good job of putting together their instructions, so it was a snap to assemble.  We moved from Arizona to Washington, so you can imagine how stressed the kitties were after 4 days in a car.  My package was waiting at my apartment when we arrived, I put it together in about 15 minutes, and they both took right to it.  If you have multiple cats, they will vie for the \'top spot\', but there is room for everyone, and I use the low box as a toy box.  Highly recommend!!!\n
 Update: The column on the top left hand side oke while my 8 lb cat was sitting in the hammock. Cat was very lucky to escape without injury. This happened after I had the tree for only a month. I had followed all directions to put the item together properly. This item is dangerous!</></>The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is because the topmost bed and the basket underneath it are very unstable and the column leans dangerously even with just a 10 lb cat on it. Definitely needs better support for the column.\n
 IF ICOULD GIVE LESS THAN ONE STAR I WOULD!!!</>I was excited to get a new cat tree, but upon opening the box and taking pieces out, discovered two pieces were not in the box! so now I have to try and rig up something to put it together! it would cost a fortune to ship back! DO NOT buy this cat tree!</>Also has a misaligned/not drilled hole, so now it stays unassembled until a friend can help &#8220;fix&#8221; it.....PIECE OF JUNK!!!\n
 The product itself is very nice; I bought the smaller of the two and it is sturdy, there are not sharp bits that kitty would step on and hurt herself. The carpet is ultra soft and it aesthetically is nice looking. I think the key thing to know though, is your cat. I waited 10 years to buy one of these for mine as I thought she would object to using it as it&# ;s a cat toy and she definitely fancies herself to be a dog. Well, here is a picture of her enjoying her new toy.\n
 My cat is almost 10 y/o and he loves it!!! I got this one because the flow of it looked easy for a senior cat to climb and it definitely delivered. It\'s sturdy but not so heavy that I can\'t move it around to clean. I don\'t love that it has them metal staples that are exposed but I checked all of them to make sure it was safe and none of them poked me or came off. All in all good for the price.\n
 In love with this cat playground. Only downside is it\'s a bit unstable for adult cats climbing up and down. Going to figure out a way to reinforce it to the floor or ace it to a wall to avoid injuries to cats and to keep playground from falling and eaking. 4 week old kittens enjoy climbing up the post. Don\'t mind the mess in the photo please lol we\'re keeping them in the shed (insulted with ac) till we can adopt out the other three kittens and build their new catio.\n
 My two cats love this tree! It has a hammock, a carpeted nook that is big enough for sleeping, and plenty of scratching posts. It is also pretty tall. This was assembled in minutes. There is also a mouse hanging from the top tier that my cats go crazy for.  A vine of plastic leaves that you can twist around the tree is also included. The only issue I had was that this took exactly 1 week from date of order to receive. It was listed as Prime eligible, so I expected it in 2 days, not 7 !!\n
 Much more sturdy with the 4 point base vs a lot of trees that use 3. My cats are hammock nuts and this is perfect for window watching while hammocking. The fake leaves are a fun little addition. They encourage playfulness and a little distruction (better directed at fake leaves than the toilet paper roll).\n
 Our kitty was crazy, clawing up anything she could, climbing my chairs like crazy.  We got this and she loves it!  She loves it so much and spends hours every day at various perches.  She climbs it instead of jumping and she now uses it as her preferred scratching post.  When she climbs and is crazy it is on her cat tower.  I consider it money very well spent.\n
 It took Amazon 5 days to finally ship ! If i knew i would buy directly from the store (not amazon). They used to ship packages within 1-3 days, now is closer to 5-8 days! Product itself is pretty good, but not recommend for bigger cats, would be perfect for kittens. My cat is only about 8lb and he can hardly fit in to the hammock. The bottom is not wood (not heavy enough) so the construction not very sturdy. But my cat like it (have it for only 2 days now).\n
 My two cats LOVE this cat tree. One of cats just wanted to chew on the leaves so I just removed it completely. Its tall which I liked its about 5\'8\'\' ish and its easy to clean it since well having one being a short hair Siamese and the other is Himalayan. Over all structure is good. I would recommend this to everyone who wants color coordinate their room to match this (I did XD lamp shade theory on my seal point Siamese ). I would have to say the one con to this is best for maybe two light weight cats 5-8 lbs cats kinda wobbles when both my cats are on it. Also the own kinda sheds when the cats are going after it for scratch post but its whatever its a great cat tree totally worth it for price when I got it\n
 Loveeee this tree! I think it was slightly over priced, but in all reality worth it! My fat cat loves this thing. It\'s his safe place from the dogs and he can happily sit on the top perch to look down at all of us peasants. The ball at the top was easily plucked off by my evil cat, but I knew he would do that... The leaves were a nice touch, however, those were pulled apart by him as well. (Not the sellers fault, my cat is a her and just likes to destroy nice things) we have had this tree for a little under a year and it\'s held together very well, it does need some tightening here and there, but I think it\'s because my cat is obese. All in all I recommend this to every cat owner!\n
 I read the reviews about this product eaking while people&# ;s cats are on it. The cat tree hasn&# ;t oken yet (1 month in), however I see now the concerns and think it will eak any day now. The tree was tricky to put together as the parts didn&# ;t line up well.\n
 Despite the materials being very lightweight and thin and not confidence inspiring at all, reminiscent of the super cheapo Chinese cat trees, the design of this makes it so that when fully constructed it is amazingly solid.  Due to the height I have it up against a wall, but its very popular with both the cats after infusing some catnip into the rope.  Only thing I\'d do, which is easy, is remove the dangling mouse on the elastic string.  Its a choking hazard.\n
 This is a Gorgeous tree!  My Zen room is done in a jungle theme and this tree fits decor beautifully.  My cat loves most of the tree, she won\'t go up on the top two levels or hammock/basket.  Try not to laugh, but I have to have the only cat afraid of heights. Super easy to put together, 20 minutes.  Seems very sturdy as well.  You would easily pay almost double at your local pet store.  Great cat tree, Great price!\n
 This is tall and symmetrical for two cats to play on. The top hiding tube feel so strange and unsecured balanced on the top but so far no issues with my 9 lbs cats. Best to leave off the hiding box section and leave the large open perch. Very easy assembly. I wasn&# ;t intimidated by it at all. I bought an &#8220;open box/used&#8221; one from amazon but it&# ;s perfect and had prime shipping. Pleased with the purchase\n
 Pros:  looks good in a room, sturdy, easy to assemble.</>Con: 2 of the levels needed to be more off center.  My cats had a difficult time trying to get to the top level. (Which is where they prefer.)  One cat is older and the other is a large cat.  Not enough space for them.  Had to ing out their old one as after a while they gave up and wouldn&# ;t use it.\n
 This tree took roughly 40 minutes for me to put together myself with the included wrench thing. If people are complaining of stability I cannot help but think they tried to use a regular screwdriver, which is useless in this case! The included wrench thing is perfect for the job! My kitten was already all over the pieces before I even started assembling it. 5 well deserved stars, and would highly recommend to anyone I know! Destiny approved!!\n
 My cats friggin love this thing. The leaves are a joke though, the just fall off and even if mine would have stayed on my 2 cats would have sliced them off when they go to scratch the posts. I will be buying another to have a pair. And the overall layout is structurally sound as my 6, 4, and 3 yr old often enjoy sneaking to the 2nd tier and using it as a seat while using the 3rd tier as a desk of sorts.\n
 The box in the middle is too large for this unit. The space between the supports and the box is just enough that my cat has almost hanged himself twice (that I know about).  His poor little head gets stuck in there. I\'ve already removed the hammock as my cats get stuck in the sisal ropes holding it up and  I am removing this box so my cat has a chance to live a long and happy life.\n
 The tallest tower is shoddily made and dangerous for your pets. Within a few weeks of constructing it the tower began to lean heavily. I took it down and reattached it in the hopes of fixing it. It seemed to work, and the tower did not lean again. Last night my wife was woken up to a crash. The tower had snapped at the base with one of our cats in it. Thankfully he was unhurt, but the event was extremely stressful. We are extremely surprised at how shoddy the tower at least seemed. Out cats are all average weight, well within the supposed weight limits of this product. For the safety of your cats I would not recommend this product.\n
 Was not fully carpeted per visual display and the instruction were not very good, plus confusing on front or back views.  My cat tree came out lopsided no matter how it was assembled and reassembled, some of the pieces length were not exact.  Over all it\'s ok, just had better cat trees with better directions and fitted pieces.\n
 My large 14 lb male cat (he\'s a large tabby, and not overweight for his size) was too heavy for the original design of the tree...I reconfigured it to a more stable window height seat for him. Now he likes it and feels way more secure on it. Smaller, lighter cats would probably be able to use this in the intended configuration...but I almost want to say there is a lot of wobble at the top and maybe only really appropriate for kittens to young cats.\n
 The cat tree itself is great, once built.</></>CONS</>-Instructions were a tad bit confusing</>-the ladder part came oke</>-the cubby on the very top keeps tipping over because the bolt on the bottom keeps falling out</>-I had to use part of the oken ladder to insert in between the short white post and the top cubby roof, as you can see in the picture.</></>PROS</>-many baskets and hammocks for my 3 cats</>-cats use them often</>-all of the equipment was there</>-no missing items</>-tall</>-stable</></>Otherwise, my kitties LOVE this tree. I\'m just lucky that none of the important parts came oken. I would have given this a 5 star IF no parts came oken AND the instructions were better.\n
 Sturdy, over 6\' tall, and filled with fun places for the cats.  My cat loves it and he has never had a tree before.  It did take him a bit to get used to it.  It\'s sturdy enough for me to put his food dish on the second from the top tier to keep it from the dogs.  And he loves sitting on the top post and "lording" above us all.  Looks cute in my living room, too - which I never thought I\'d say.  I\'m really happy with this purchase.\n
 Very cute. Must say, it is much more attractive than I thought it would be. It is quite large though, so consider the base size before committing, as you might be giving up an entire wall in your home.</></>As for the product itself, it came disassembled with a small wrench for tightening screws. Fairly easy to assemble, though one of the screws in the scoop-looking piece, which attaches to the larger flat black piece only holds the top of the piece (scoop piece)  if it is faced up (not down, with the flathead flush with the walking surface. This makes for a small pointy object sticking up out of an area the cats might lay down. Not well thought through in terms of mechanics.</></>Pros:</></>- East to put together</>- Attractive</>- Somewhat reasonably priced (see comment below)</></>Cons:</></>- The screw issue, as noted before</>- The material isn\'t durable (very thin and likely to wear out within a year, which means replacing the whole thing)</>- The material wasn\'t attached well, as my cat attempted to scratch one of the own fuzzy posts and it peeled right off (hardly any glue holding it on and it\'s paper thin)</>- It isn\'t particularly sturdy; it wobbles. I read that here and thus tightened the screws extra tight, but alas, it\'s just not solid (think cheap IKEA particle board).</></>Overall, I\'d say that if you want a well-made and durable cat condo/tree, you may want to go with a carpet covered one and not purchase this and. Further, the wobbly nature of the tree means one of my cats refuses to get on it and the other is always nervous while on it (she meows at me as a request to get her down).</></>In terms of cost/value, I\'m of mixed feelings: Costco sells really durable cat condos with carpet that last years (at least mine lasted 7 years and probably will continue on past that with its new owner) and this thing will likely last about a year with two older cats (i.e. they aren\'t rough or destructive) because it simply falls apart.</></>Is it a good deal? Well, it is certainly attractive (pro for me). It probably won\'t last very long, as an entire piece of faic coming off in the first two days due to the cat scratching doesn\'t bode well for it in the long-term. I really don\'t think you should ever need to glue pieces back on to a cat tree, let alone off the bat.</></>All in all, I\'ll keep it because it\'s together and I think it\'s pretty. However, if I were attempting to make a decision about purchasing a quality cat condo/tree, this certainly wouldn\'t be it.\n
 Love the tree but received mine missing a screw and pieces of the foliage. Can&# ;t attach the top part because of missing screw. As for the leaves we just put them on the top inside of the sides like shown since there isn&# ;t a enough. Hoping I can find a screw that fits :/\n
 I like it more than my cats.  The vines keep falling off and the cats couldn\'t care less.  The top circle is a little wobbly and I cant figure out how to fix it.\n
 That is why this cat tree rocks!</></>It&# ;s a tower, it&# ;s symetical, it doesn&# ;t go this way or that way.  It just goes up.</></>If you are looking for a cat tower that wasn&# ;t over engineered with extras your cat will probably never use,  this is it!</></>Oh, and my cat likes it too\n
 I have had this tree for nearly 3 years now. Still looks great. Has held up extremely well with 2 cats. One is 14 pounds and climbs to the top. Other than having to replenish the sisal posts due to tearing when cats use them, but only once a year, (can be a real pain because I have to take it apart), I love it!!! Looking at replacing with anot Go Pet Cat Tree. Quality and durability are fantastic!!!\n
 My cats absolutely adore this tree.  I like its layout and the touch of nature that it gets from the plastic leaves.</></>The only cons I can think of is it has kind of a weird smell, which is still there months after I bought it, and the two tallest platforms on the top are really wobbly.  I\'m planning on balancing them together by tying twine around one, putting a section of pvc pipe over the twine, then tying it tight around the other one.\n
 Two of my four cats absolutely LOVE this.  And it looks good too, blends in a little with the house d&#233;cor.  The carpet is very soft and cleans up easily, it seems to be well made, plus there is plenty of rope on the posts to scratch their nails on.  The greenery was pretty, but my cats chewed it apart and ate the plastic stems (OH NO!) and now I just have a pile of plastic leaves.  It is for smaller cats.  My kitten and small younger cat love to race up and down the tree, they utilize every level (even the very top) with the exception of the box, no one seems to go in there.  I did have to put weights on the bottom of the tree, probably 60 lbs of hand weights are on the bottom to keep it stable.  Without the add\'l weights it would tip over, no doubt, the way the cats run up and down.  Even with 60lbs it still sways a little but I don\'t think it will fall over.  My two larger (12lb &amp; 23lb) cats have no interest, they just don\'t fit on the shelves and the instability scares them a little.  My kitten loves the little basket which is velvety soft, but she will outgrow it one day, it\'s small.  I LOVE this cat tree and would highly recommend it if you have smaller cats/kittens. It\'s well made, just be sure to add weight to the bottom to keep it upright.\n
 i have 2 cats, one small and one bigger (like 10-12lbs.) and both LOVE this tree. it wobbles a bit when they hop on the very top so i might recommend you anchor it to the wall if you can, but its fine as it is for me. they dont mind the little wobble. its also softer than expected, and larger than any other cat tree i\'ve owned. VERY easy to put together, took maybe 10-15 minutes with my boyfriend. overall, i love this cat tree, and so do my cats :)\n
 As soon as it went up, the cats moved in. Couple of issues, 1. The top bed was damage, but nothing I can\'t fix with a little hot glue. 2. it\'s not as sturdy as I would like it, but the skinny cat like to sleep high, and my fat cat took over the bottom house. Over all if they like it, I like it.\n
 My cat adores the sled. It\'s the purr-fect height for him to watch the birds from our window. It is really well made, not hard to put together (It did take me about an hour, but I wasn\'t rushing). The leaves are adorable, and my cat left them alone until my dog took notice and began to pull them off. For a week it was autumn in my living room each morning. For the price, it was an amazing steal. I\'ve had friends who thought I paid way more than I did because it looks so nice in the room.\n
 This is just a AMAZING cat condo! I was baffled at the good quality, great material, easiness of putting it together &amp; sturdiness of this cat condo especially for the ridiculously low price!! This condo would easily cost 4 to 5 times what its being sold for on Amazon if you were buy it in a store! I have 7 cats and they absolutely love this! I did a lot of research trying to find the best cat condo and I looked at over 500 different types &amp; sizes of cat condos and I couldn\'t be happier with my choice of buying this one!! There was a issue with the shipping but ended up being the post offices fault not Amazons, but Amazon was very helpful and quickly responsive dealing with this shipping issue so I was very pleased with Amazon for how they handled that as well! Thank you thank you!!!\n
 Cats love the food bowl.  We had to take down the pedestal after a few months of play as the inner core was faulty and afraid it would tip over.  The top house isn\'t very large as you can see in photo.  Patches is a 9 lb rescue.  They still enjoy regardless.  Forget attaching the leaves just more to clean up&#128556;\n
 My cats love it. The color is nicer since it doesn\'t look dirty lije the lighter colors do. Has room for my cats food and everything they need. Putting it together felt like it took forever because nothing was labelled and figuring out which pole was which toom some time.\n
 While it is a very nice looking cat tree, the scratching posts are in a weird spot. They should be at the bottom of the tree and all the posts should have the twine around them for extra scratching. My cats don\'t use the hammock, or the cat box. They prefer the top cylinder to sleep. I would probably order a different tree if I was in the market again.\n
 This cat tree was the best investment I made for my cats. They loved it. And it was basically indestructible, aside from the fake foliage.\n
 I was about to go into a whole Darkwing Duck reference, but realized that might sound crazy more so than helpful. BUT! The cat loves it, and it\'s strong enough to withstand him jumping around all willy nilly. Would recommend.\n
 I got this for my 1 year old girl, she was a bit confused and didn&# ;t know what to think of it at first, but now it&# ;s her favorite spot in the house. Fairly sturdy for kittens and smaller cats. It wobbled a bit at first but you just need to make sure the screws are completely tightened. Carpet is very soft. The leaves might need to be removed as she has tried to eat them a few times.\n
 F2097 - not sturdy at all, I have to prop it up in the front to not tetter as much</>F2090 - not sturdy but better than # F2097, I don\'t trust the pedestal not against a wall, my 9lb cat looks like she will snap it off when she gets on top of it\n
 We have four cats, and have gone through a lot of cat trees.  This was by far their favorite, and the only one that we\'ve bought multiple times!  It looks great, and holds up better than other ones.</></>The curved landing above the box at the bottom is the weakest part of the design, but it\'s still not nearly as wobbly as those lame ladders on some tree models.\n
 Love this. So happy I decided to get this one. Went looking at pet stores seeing if I could get one already assembled so I wouldn\'t have to. For the same price and more were cat trees that aren\'t half of what this one is. There is so much for them. Super tall so they can get away from the dogs whenever they want. Very sturdy. The wait to receive it and the time spent to put it together was well worth it. It took me less than an hour by myself to assemble it. I have 2 happy cats and a happy family.\n
 This is a very nice cat tree, just not really made for medium to large cats. Kittens would probably have a great time with it. My cats range from 9lbs to 17lbs. The smallest one can maneuver between shelves but with some difficulty. The larger ones, no dice. They sit only on the one shelf they can jump to from the couch and that&# ;s it.</>The base was a pain putting together. You might want to have a second person around to help.\n
 This is awesome!  My cat loves it!  I did take off the top platform because my cat is a little over weight and clumsy so the top platform gave her some issues.  It is very sturdy and easy enough to put together.  I did not use the green leaves that wrap around it because I was afraid my cat would try to eat it.....She is a very special cat so I don\'t put anything past her!!!  I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who has cats!\n
 Cats absolutely love it. We didn\'t put the fake leaves up. It does need to be tightened periodically as it will start to wave and move a good bit after the cats have been up and down. It isn\'t going to last 10 years but it will be good for a while. I love the great height on it, allows the cats to sit in the 2nd tier window in the living room.\n
 We love this, and so do our cats! Our only issue is the lower portion, with the little house thing, is wobbly. The rest of it is very sturdy. We have retightened the screws probably three times in the past three months, not that big of a deal. Our cats are always in it, and it\'s sturdy enough our kids can climb on it too (when we\'re not watching) . It\'s very tall. Our cats like the hammock the most and often we will find both of them curled up in it.\n
 Updated August 2014:</></>I initially gave this three stars, but after living with it for a few months I learned that even two stars is probably a generous rating. My cats loved it, but the quality of this thing REALLY sucks. There are numerous options for scratching in our home so this tree didn\'t get more than a few tugs each time one of the cats jumped onto it. Nevertheless, within weeks long strands and chunks of the sisal were ripping off and settling all over the floor and the platforms below. It was completely unraveled within 3 months, and the felt at the top &amp; bottom of the posts - above and below where the sisal used to be - ended up totally shredded as well.</></>It\'s wobbly no matter how much you tighten the bolts, so I had to wedge it into a corner and anchor it to the wall. Even then the bolts in the platforms somehow seemed to loosen over time and I had to tighten them occasionally.</></>The felt covering grabs every iota of fur, dust and lint that blows anywhere near it, so I found myself vacuuming and lint-rolling the platforms constantly. Despite my best efforts it still took on a very unpleasant musty odor after a few months.</></>We moved across the country in June, and that thing did NOT come with us; it went straight into the dumpster. I purchased different products of much better quality for our new place, and I couldn\'t be happier with them. Sure they cost more up front, but I\'ll come out ahead in the long run because I won\'t have to replace them a few months from now!</></>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</>Based on the 5-star reviews here (and the raves on Wayfair.com), I had high hopes for this tree. So far I\'m a bit disappointed. Order processing was quick, it shipped out as promised and arrived at my front door within 2 days. So far, so good...until I opened the box.</></>As I removed all the platforms and pieces I discovered that the faux fur material on this thing sheds. A lot. Assembling it was easy (I managed to put it together by myself in under 30 minutes) but by the time I finished it there were fuzzy bits EVERYWHERE. After using a Swiffer cloth to wipe up as much as I could from the floor and furniture, I got out my Miele and used the ush attachment to vacuum off all the loose bits that were clinging to the posts and platforms. It helped temporarily, but for the past few days that we\'ve had the tree I\'ve been chasing floating bits of fuzz &amp; fur all over the house.</></>I\'m also disappointed at how unbelievably thin/flimsy the material is on this thing. I was expecting something a little bit cozier/cushier, but the platforms are no softer than our wood floors so I don\'t see how they would be very comfortable for the kitties. The quality of the sisal covering on the scratching posts isn\'t any better - little bits unravel and fall off every time one of the cats digs into it. The mouse that hangs from the top platform is cute, but the flimsy string attaching it didn\'t last more than 60 seconds - one good swipe and the mouse was on the floor.</></>I didn\'t bother draping the fake leaves over it. I\'m sure they\'d look cute, but my girls have a tendency to chew their way through plastic and I don\'t want them ingesting some synthetic, chemical-laden crap that was probably made in China.</></>On the plus side, the base of this tree is wider than some of the other tall ones I\'ve seen. It\'s still a little wobbly if the cats are jumping around on it, but securing it to the wall will take care of that.</></>Overall I\'m not very happy with the quality, but it\'ll do for now. I\'m just glad it wasn\'t a huge investment - if it lasts for 6 months I\'ll consider it to be a worthwhile purchase.\n
 I have a Maine coon and she is too big for the top part but refuses to let it be waisted. She is always up there. The tree rocks a little when she jumps on it or plays but it\'s not going to knock over. It\'s very nice quality but the leaves can be done without. It stops the car from getting a good grasp and climb. The tree is very tall and narrow which I love. Overall I love it because my cat does!\n
 1 of my cats actually stood on the very tip top looking out the window. I couldn\'t believe it the other two love the condo part and they all like climbing all over it.</> Bob and Cinnamon Bun (in the top looking out) chillin in the cat tree.\n
 My son and I had a great time putting it together. It was not difficult, and the kitties enjoyed the process! They like the cat tree very much, especially my younger cat who is still a kitten at one year. She went nuts over the little hanging mousy and by the end of the evening/next morning had pulled it off. My son just tied it back, and there it has stayed. She likes the hammock to rest in. The older kitty (5 years) likes the tree, too, but she is more cautious. The greenery makes the tree attractive, though the kitties have torn up some of it a little. The younger kitty likes to climb to the top of the tree. Overall, this has been a successful purchase.\n
 I\'m absolutely in love with this cat tree! It was super easy to put together with just the given allen wrench! My cat started playing with the pieces before it was even built! It took me about half an hour to build it in its entirety. It\'s beautiful and very soft! The only downfall is that the vines don\'t have an attachment, so tying them around each other occasionally oke the vine into a smaller piece. Overall, it\'s perfect for my fur babies!\n
 This tower is so much studier than the last one we bought. Our cats love the upper levels, especially the hammocks and baskets (&amp; the very top seat). My only critique is the top platform doesn\'t connect to the top basket and seat column on the left, and they definitely need the added support. We used a rope to tie the left column to the main base (the own columns) so it wouldn\'t lean forward as much. But overall, great tower!\n
 Nice tree for our 4 cats. Desi the 4 month old Maine Coon took to it immediately. He likes the top perch of course. Snap to put together and took about 45 minutes and I took my time. Recommend laying everything out first as there are 17 pole sections of varying sizes. One reviewer said the faux leaves are a little cheesy but the cat loves them so I\'ll let them stay. If you live upstairs recommend you have help moving it into position. I did it by myself and with the help of a 2 wheeler got it into the house from basement where I put it together. Would probably have been smarter to put it together where I set it up. It weighs about 75 pounds assembled.\n
 Was a little disappointed at the  directions. It would have been nice to have all the pieces grouped and labeled when they were packaged. It wasn\'t hard to figure out which pieces were which but it still would have been nice. No words, just pictures for directions. Pretty straight forward. My cats love it\n
 I literally just received it today. SUPER fast shipping, thank you to the seller for that!</>The set up was super easy and the instructions were fool proof. It even comes with a handy dandy tool to put it all together. It doesn\'t take a genius for it to all come together.</>The faic is super soft and looks nice as well.</>My cat could not wait for me to finish putting it all together. It took me a total of maybe 20 mins.</>I\'ll update in a few months with a follow up.\n
 I\'ve only had this for about 5 months and it was well worth it. My cats luv it! I have two cats one is about 6lbs &amp; 3yrs old, the other is about 15lbs and 9yrs old.</>I was concerned that my 15lb cat wouldn\'t get much use out of it but I was wrong. He goes up to the top and sits. I\'m suprised at how sturdy it is. He hasn\'t tipped it yet! He pretty much lives in the hamick even thou he\'s too big for it.</>The only complaints i have are:  the mouse didn\'t last most than 10 mins after set up, it\'s only stapled on the bottom of the top tier with a small staple. The cats were able to pull the leaves off the vines very easily and in no time (if I were to build it again I wouldn\'t put them on. They only lasted maybe a week). I wish the hamick was a little bigger for my lager cat (he luvs it but he looks a little funny splilling over the top lol). the instructions were not the greatest but I read up on it on line before i purchased it and knew to look it up on u-tube which made it a lot easier to assemble. I would like foir it to have 2 hamicks one for each cat.\n
 The base isn\'t weighted, so when my cat climbs all over it the tree wobbles. After a few times, he seems to have gotten spooked and really won\'t climb it unless there\'s something interesting in the window. And if it topples he definitely won\'t climb it again. I have old textbooks on the base to help weigh it down but it doesn\'t help. I wouldn\'t buy it again, but it was a pain to build (definitely a two-person job) and I don\'t want to disassemble it and return, especially since my cat sorta uses it.</></>Buyer beware!\n
 This is a great product. Sturdy. Top quality. Well built. The cats love the design, all the levels and leaves. I&# ;m glad I chose this one! I did a lot of research on reviews and designs  of kitty towers. This one is great! Easy to assemble! Well worth the money.  This one seems like it will last a long time.\n
 Our cat loves this tree! She has yet to hide in the bottom "box" or to sit on the utmost platform with frequency, but everything else gets regular use as a jungle gym, scratching post, bed, or lookout tower. She\'s rather lazy by nature, but having this activity center seems to have helped her energy level and she uses it without regular enticement (we have historically had to use cat nip to get her to pay attention to other toys). My husband even commented that it makes the room look more complete.\n
 &#160;I recently built a catio for both of my cats love it! It is high enough for them to climb I would say its almost 7 ft high. In addition, the pieces are soft and comfortable enough for them to lounge around. Very sturdy and can carry my weight when I climb on the catio. Amazing product!\n
 It\'s IS tall &amp; arrives in a rather short box ... I hate assembling furniture.  This was very do-able ... as I watched Petros assemble it for me while feeling rather cheesy for not even bothering to open the short box before asking for help.  I ordered one for my friend as a gift, I\'ll help her assemble it.  Oh ... the cats love it AND (bonus) it looks lovely in my living room\n
 Came oken already pretty sad :( so not sure how long it will really last if it&# ;s oken before my pets even use it\n
 Awesome cat tower, my cat loves it. He goes on all the towers and is in love with this. It\'s safe and cool and took about two hours to put together which wasn\'t too bad. They messed up my order twice and I had to do two returns, but they gave me a full refund making this a good five stars in my book, especially since my cat loves it even though there was a long wait.\n
 Looks very nice. Easy to put together...I didn\'t even put the vines on it. I know the cats would tear it off in a couple days.</>It is covered with a soft faux fur and not carpet. My cats have never had a cat tree so they get on it some but still prefer our furniture. It is a little wobbly on carpet but doesn\'t act like it will turn over. It would probably do a lot better on a solid flooring.\n
 My two smaller cats like this structure. This is more for kittens and small cats. My 21 lbs cat does not use it much because of his size. I took the hammock off. My guys did not use that and I was concerned about possible issues I read about in other reviews.\n
 Easy to put together. Tools were included. Both of our cats love it. It is stable. No regrets!</></>Update: Four months later and both of our cats still love this. I wish there was a way to add on a second hammock. They both love to nap in the hammock and they politely take turns. This was a fantastic purchase I am glad we made.\n
 I\'ve be searching for a tree for "adult" cats and even use those specific search words.  This item is surprising built well for the price however the three perches are NOT large enough for adult cats.  Again, the item is nice and well built, just not realistic for large adults.\n
 Pretty nice, kinda tall and not sure if my older cat will be able to climb it.  Also very poor instructions on how to put together.  The parts are not labeled either.\n
 This is a very nice cat tree.  My cats are super rough, so it does some swaying when they pounce on it, but so far it is holding up great.  There may not be a cat tree anywhere that is this tall and doesn\'t sway somewhat when pounced on!  Would definitely buy this and again and recommend it to cat mommies and daddies.\n
 2 cats - both a year old.  One is extreme extrovert, other is complete introvert.  others.  They both love it.  They don\'t use the "scoop" in the middle, but they do seem to love the "bowl".  The bowl is an iron ring covered in soft durable faic.  The product is really sturdy.  There is a hole in the center platform that allows climbing up to top but it is awkwardly placed since the cats have trouble navigating around it to reach the bowl platform.  I may switch the top and middle centers.\n
 This is a beautiful cat tree. My cat loves it. It has a wide base and a small house at the bottom which help to keep it stable. It comes with a nice tin bowl for snacks. Overall worth the money.\n
 I was skeptical because it was a great sale and usually things like that don\'t go on sale at such a discount. it turns out to be a great product. Easy to put together even if a tiny bit wobbly. It took my cat a few days to get used to it, mostly because my weird takes his time with things that don\'t smell like home but now he loves it...and what\'s most important the baby can\'t get him there!!! oh, and I love the way it looks, great color and design!\n
 this is a nice looking cat tree but it needs more scratching posts. The entire bottom part is covered in soft faic when it should be an area for the cat to scratch. The sides are too narrow for my small 6 lb cat to sit on so she won\'t even use this thing. I would only recommend this for a kitten.\n
 Awesome cat tree! It shipped very quickly and came in perfect condition. My boyfriend was able to assemble it easily, and the cats were so excited for it! The box it comes in is pretty big, but that\'s totally reasonable being such a large tree. Idk why people are saying these are hard to put together. The picture instructions are very clear and simple, so obviously it\'s an operator error.. lol. My largest cat is 16 pounds easy and fits on it comfortably, and plays super rough! Absolutely worth the price and would recommend to others.\n
 This was easy to assemble and is 7&# ; tall! My cats love it. All the other ones at the pet stores are three times the cost. My suggestion it needs a weighted base. I wedged mine against the wall by my couch and is fine. It&# ;s too heavy. I put all my workout weights on the bottom and it was sturdy then. LOL\n
 Would have been less stressful had the pieces been labeled to match the instructions\n
 My cats love it the little hammock not so much but it could be just  my kitties preference  same goes for the top piece but again probably my kitties preference but over all they love it it\'s aesthetically pleasing for me and then it\'s furrocious fun for them. They even nap on it haha when it got here they played with the parts and when it was assembled they were just so overwhelmed and happy it was definitely worth every penny\n
 We love this cat tree almost as much as our cats do, even though we have cats on the chubbier side this tree hasnt tumbled over yet! They enjoy it and it looks so cool we will definitely be getting more in the future!\n
 I had to fix the tree because the bottom cubby came oken in half so I had to fix it.the instructions were terrible none of the pieces were labeled you had to measure the pieces in order to put them together I was too hard headed to measure them so I just did it on my own took me a lot longer to build this tree.took me 7 hours.  but it was well worth it in the end because my cats love it and play on it everyday.\n
 The cats love it.  Go Pet Club products are well made and stand up to heavy use from our multiple cats.  The kitties like the scratching areas and they scramble up and down it all day.  If you have a particularly chubby cat, I suggest you put a heavy weight on the bottom to help prevent tip-overs.\n
 Both of my cats love this tree. They banter with each other while on different levels. They love the top level as a perch from which to view the room. They both use the vertical supports as scratching posts (the posts are wrapped for the purpose of being used as such). Because the levels don\'t have the lip around the perimeter as other cat condos or towers often do, my larger cat is able to rest comfortably. My reason for four stars instead of five: I wish the base was heavier to lend more stability to the top two levels. Not a problem with my smaller cat, but when the larger one makes his way up or down the tower, the tower is a bit wobbly. Overall, please as punch with my purchase.\n
 Bought this one for our new patio (catio?) screen room....easy assembly.....cats love it....BUT, between our textured concrete, and  the way the bolts stick down out of the bottom makes it rock a lot....not enough to fall down, but kind of un-nerving when the big cat climbs up....I am probably going to put a circle of weather strip around the bottom to make it less wobbly....\n
 The product seems to be good enough, should we get it all in one piece. We made our first purchase on the 9th, however the shipment arrived and we were missing half of our tree. We contacted Amazon support and they recommended a return and a repurchase. Alas, the second order arrived with the half we were missing the first time around. When I contacted Amazon for a 3rd time on the 19th, they said they would issue a refund and send a 3rd replacement. They ALSO said they would take the item down to make sure everyone else avoids the rampant issues with the shipping of this item [which they have not]. I would advise not purchasing this item until the distribution/shipping items have been taken care of.</></>What I believe is happening is this: I think there is an issue between the distribution center and the amazon page. The cat tree is obviously very large... it is supposed to come with at least two packages. Each time we have ordered they have sworn that it was to arrive in one single shipment and box. So, the website needs to either reflect this or customers need to have better information. Either way it has been entirely frustrating... it was supposed to be a valentines day gift.</></>Believe me, we would LOVE to have the whole product... eventually. I will update once we have the whole product.</></>[Update 2-21-14 - The 3rd shipment arrived. It is wrong AGAIN. One box, with half the parts. At least some other review-ers got their entire product.]</></>[Update 5-2-14 - We never ended up getting our full tree. No one knew what they were talking about when we called. Amazon even said they would make the product unavailable until they could sort out the issues. Guess what is still available for other people to purchase and have a hard time with?!]\n
 I just got this yesterday and it took me 30 minutes to put together. I love it because it is not too wide, easy to move and way more stable than I expected. My cat is very lonely since I cannot have another cat right now and this seemed to lift his spirits. I put it under a window so he could climb up into the window and sit if he chooses. Best cat tree I have ever invested in. Don\'t settle for a cat tree under this one, its worth the money.\n
 I have had this condo for about 7 months. It has held up fantastic! I have a savannah cat. Let me tell you, he is a big and rough boy! The top gets lose but just needs a tighten down from time to time and it\'s a little small for him but should be fine for a smaller cat. Overall he loves it and spends most of his time running up and down it!\n
 I purchased this for our family of four cats. Two are two years apart (eleven and thirteen) and came from no-kill shelters. We have had the boys since they were kittens. The other two are street-finds effectuated by my son in Nashville. The female is six years old. He kept the male. We have had her for a little over six months. Moving to Florida disrupted life for them and the others of his ood were keeping her from the food plate. She\'s mine NOW! The other is a find that his girl friend found outside her house in the street. He is two, but we took him right away. I have seen many Turkish vans in my life; this one comes without papers,  but is still the real thing.</>In any event, the tree went up easily in our retirement home in Florida. What surprised me was that the young lady of the bunch, made the hammock hers immediately. The huge fuzzy ground cat, went to live in the box at the bottom. Jack, the Turkish van, scampers up the side of the tree and makes the top post his look-out. It is MUCH more sturdy than the reviews I read here. Of course, the rope was going to go. None of our cats have had their claws removed just in case they ACCIDENTALLY get outside. I will NOT take their weapons away. This neighborhood is built in a part of Pasco County, Florida where there are feral cats on the move through our neighborhood all night long. The boys and the girl are here to stay ... inside. The tree is a very good buy for the money. I am about to order another one for our family room.\n
 This an amazing product! My cat used to sleep all of the time in her old cat tree, and now plays constantly with the hanging mouse. I rotated the top platform to make it easier for my cat to climb up and down.\n
 Great find. Four stars because one of the platform particle board was cracked when delivered. Still functional. Looks great. Cats like it with the scratching posts and hanging ropes.\n
 Made of 68 pounds of sturdy particle board, this cat house is designed to whole weight...</></>While difficult at first to put together, the finished product is well worth the cost.\n
 My boys love this cat tree! It&# ;s big and beautiful, honestly a dream cat tree lol. So far it&# ;s held up with my Chonks too\n
 My 12 year old son put this together in  trice. And while in the few hours it has been up, I have yet to see our actual cat, Chester, using the tree.  It is however,  covered in Chester hair, which I view as good sign. My son has also noted Chester scratching the dickens out of the rope tubes.  This was the entire reason for buying this (expensive) tower of pressed wood and faic.  I love my lazy-boy and DO NOT want I to be a casualty of kitty claws.</>While I do not consider myself a "pet-parent", I do believe that animals should have their own space and autonomy----a common curtsy amongst sentient beings.</>DETAILS</>1-yes, the carpet is plush and VERY cat friendly</>2-the rope around intermittent poles are a cat fav!</>3-it took my 12 year-old 15 min or less to put together</>4-yes, the leaves come with it, but why, deco for humans?</>5-catnip or cat grass scent would be nice, or at least a packet</>6-sturdy for several cats</>7-perfect for corner in ANY room. we set it up in the oversized dining room\n
 My cats love this thing, it\'s holding up nicely tooo (they do battle often an very hard)</></>Only thing i don\'t like it\'s the plastic leaves. My cats started to eat them.\n
 The carpeting is soft and there\'s plenty of things for the cats to do on this tree. It\'s very esthetic and very large. Great deal. It\'s my second purchase of this same tree and the quality is just the same.\n
 We have 2 cats (both about 9 lbs) and they refused to go on it for the first week. The one I think was afraid of the bed at the top at first but once they got used to it they love it now. Our puppy also loves the little box at the bottom\n
 Smaller than expected...my 16 lb. cat wants to love it but has trouble making his way around on it since it\'s a bit small for him. And he doesn\'t fit in the little hammock well at all. It\'s also not as tough as the "carpet covered" units you get at the local "Pet*****" or Pet**". It does look nice, but sadly it\'s not getting much use.\n
 I have two young cats (siblings), who are two years old.  I also have one older cat (a former stray) who is visibly old.  They all love the jungle.  The princess sits in the room on top, while the prince likes to play with the hanging mouse, and jump all over the whole thing for no reason.  In the meanwhile, Uncle B just sits on the base and supervises them.  It\'s so fun!\n
 fun and interesting designs make it very interesting for the cat! that and the earthy colors make it an addition to the room instead of an eyesore! fairly well made. Wide base and even distribution of the design makes for a pretty stable cat tower. Can\'t beat the price either for the aesthetic and unique builds.\n
 Better than expected! Like others have been saying, its highly annoying that the company didnt label the parts. But the final product is well worth it. We have four cats, one weighing 19lbs, and they all fit. Its super sturdy and has lots of room to play.\n
 Good quality but the shipment was bad, missing pieces and no second page of instructions. Nice for mulit cats and tall. But I am not happy. Also the two hammocks are missing screws to hold the other side together so it don\'t swing. If I could I would want my money back. On better note that Amazon was so helpful. If it wasn\'t for them I wouldn\'t have it tomorrow\n
 Don\'t buy this!! Pay attention to the bad reviews unlike I did. On the box it says 1 of 2, but I only got one box, so I was missing like 1/3 of the parts..can\'t really put it together with a bunch of missing parts! One of the beds was coming apart when I took it out of the box! It was put together with nails, same exact issue someone else had. Same thing on mine! The bottom kitty cat thing had oken corners and edges as well. We returned it, don\'t go through the hassle of buying it and realizes it sucks and returning it. Just don\'t do it!\n
 I volunteer at animal rescue taking care of our cats. I recently bought 2nd one of these for our cattery. It&# ;s all time fav of our residents. From the bottom part that some use as a hidey hole when wanting to nap to fully lounging hoping for a belly rub up at the top. Highly recommend.\n

 My cat was obsessed with this tree. I was nervous because he is 20 pounds that it would not work for him. It held him perfectly. Unfortunately due to his bad hips we had to rehome the tree to another kitty that is just obsessed with it as mine was. The bowl and the hanging mouse are a favorite for them.\n
 My cats LOVE their new house.  Assembly was very easy, it took me around 40 minutes from start to finish.  However, I thought the fake plant leaves looked a little cheesy so I didn\'t bother adding them. I highly recommend this cat house!\n
 It took a few weeks for my cats to accept this tree as their own, but after rubbing in plenty of catnip... well, my biggest one (20# large fluffy mutt cat) loves the basket. The toy has oken off, but I\'m not worried about that. It has held up quite well and is very nice looking. Some of the leaves have been chewed off by the cats, but most are still there. I vacuum it off every other time I vacuum so it stays looking nice. It is still very sturdy, and it has been pushed around a lot to vacuum carpet underneath the stand. (I bought a year ago)\n
 This cat tree is great for us.  For kitty, it is tall enough to get high above all the dog and human action, it is covered in a nice, soft short fur-type faic, and it has a lot of different spaces.  For pet parents, it was fairly easy to assemble and took less than an hour, it is compact enough to fit into a corner of the house, and the price is pretty good compared to some others.  When assembled, it looks just like the photo, but we didn\'t receive as many vines with ours.  Not a big deal, we can buy some at a local store if we want more or the ones we received end up getting a little torn.\n
 Fantastic size for the apartment I live in.  Goes together fairly simply and even lends itself to some modification in layout.  I didn\'t want to have it the full height so I used the wrench screw instead of the double ended screw and it fits together snugly.  Now to wait for them to find the tree more fascinating than the plastic bag it came in. Typical cat...\n
 I was super excited about this cat tree when I ordered it. I received it in the mail and immediately went to put it together, unfortunately, the base of the cat tree was out of alignment so there was no way for me to put the tree together. While I was frustrated I had my friend try to put it together with no luck. I will be returning this product and using the other cat tree I ordered for the time being.\n
 Were going to have to order more of the little hammocks as they love them and the company that makes this item can and will do that too!. Easy to put together, all parts were included along with an Allan wrench. I\'d post a pic to show that my trio love their new tree! Great buy and gotta love prime shipping for this!\n
 This is a very well manufactured item. It is very solid and sturdy. Took about 20 minutes to put together. My cat loves it and instantly made it his new home. I didn\'t bother with the vines because I know where they would end up. I definitely recommend this for anyone who\'s looking for a good product at a good price and free 2 day shipping with prime.\n
 My 2 cats seem to like this pretty well. They don&# ;t go on it a lot yet but hoping  they will. It does wobble a bit which I don&# ;t love but otherwise a nice cat tree\n
 Assembly is super easy and the construction is very sturdy!  I would absolutely recommend Go Pet Club...we\'ve bought 3 of them; one for myself, one for my daughter and one for my mom.\n
 This review is late but perhaps more helpful because of that. Initially it was great looking and easy to put together. After a year, we have replaced rope on one pillar. That was no problem, easy to do. The box and half tunnel have loosened up over time. I hope I can tighten it all up again. Overall very pleased. Great for the price.\n
 What a wonderful and decorative cat tree.  Its large enough to feed my cat on so the dogs don\'t get to her food as well.  She loves looking out the window on it and it makes a lovely decorative piece for the living room.  I may add different leaves and colorful flowers to it as well!\n
 I got this for my large active Bengal cat. His other one kept tipping over. This one is sturdy and doesn&# ;t tip at all. The platforms are large enough for him to be comfortable, and it&# ;s very tall which he really likes.\n
 The condo looks nice (even comes with the green vines) but once the cats get up on to the top levels, its difficult for them to get down.  The drop from the top center to the lower center is almost a straight down drop.  They try it and then fall forward and off.  The kittens got up there once but wont go again.  Maybe when they get bigger and can handle the big jump/fall down.\n
 Received one and it was damaged.  Received the replacement and it was damaged as well. How the item is being packed and the lower quality of the materials being used seem to be the cause of the damage.  I have owned this and without issue in the past, so this was a very disappointing.\n
 My kitten (8mo/8 lbs) LOVES this tree. It was easy to assemble and is sturdy enough to handle all his manic jumps and climbs. The design itself is a matter of personal preference but for me I like the look and enjoy that it does not look like an eyesore. My only complaint is that I could not use the ivy decoration as several friends including a veterinarian warned me it would be unsafe if he tore it apart and chewed it (which is exactly what he tried to do). I definitely feel I got my moneys worth and would highly recommend this to any cat owner.\n
 Easy to assemble, good instructions, durable material and sturdy. Yes the ivy is included :) My kitten has had a blast trying to tear everything apart. The Velcro along the bottom edge was the first to be pulled apart. (doesn\'t hurt anything, quickly reattaches)\n
 This ended up being a lovely purchase. Albeit once my 10lb kitty is on the top purch it seems a bit wobbly. Love that their food dish isn\'t on the floor anymore. Great incentive to entice my kitties to explore and climb.\n
 Bought this for my 16 year old cat so she might use it rather than sit on our new treadmill.  Shes very small, only about 4 pounds, and elderly. She only used the bottom half but does seem to really like it. It is well made and attractive, as far as cat trees go anyway.\n
 Got it quicker than expected.  Looks beautiful &amp; our kitten loves it. She\'s in her own little world at this point &amp; refuses to leave her tree. The only problem I had with this was that the pieces were not labeled, making it a bit harder to build. Took a bit longer than expected but other than that it was worth it.\n
 My energetic cat looooves this condo. He&# ;s a little too big for the room but the rest of it works perfectly for him! It also looks nicer than most in my living room. Worth the cost. One piece came oken but we made it work.\n
 I really wanted to like this cat tree but I will give you 3 reasons why i am returning it.</>1. It was missing 1 part which obviously was very disappointing.</>2. Its simply not big enough for a normal size cat. The only thing she fits in is the cubby hole and my cat is very petite.</>3. Everything is very narrow and unstable. I didn\'t get to build it to its full height because of the missing piece but 3/4 of the way up it was very top</>heavy.</>There is an circular hole half way up the top that my cat fell through which seemed dangerous because when she fell she went into full on crazy cat mode and grabbed the thing with her claws and almost tipped it over. The base is 21" x 32" and this thing is i think 74" high. very top heavy.\n
 Unfortunately this did not work for my large cat.  It was no where sturdy enough and the beds were too small.  I gave it to my daughter who&# ;s cats enjoy it.\n
 Our two cats (kittens when we got this) love this tree, although they have chewed most of the leaves off, they love to run, jump, and climb up the tree. They also nap on it all the time.\n
 Amazing car tree, sturdy and well made, Comes with the vines. It is all accessible by adult cats, unlike other trees in which some cubbies are only for kittens.\n
 Looove this. Had many cat trees in my life and this is so pretty and big and study! My kitty loves her food on it.\n
 My cat didn&# ;t really know what to think of the tree at first. Had to take off the plastic  decorative leaves. Smells when you first get it but that&# ;s expected with new items. Catnip and treats allowed him to get used to it. My cat loves it now.\n
 I absolutely love this purchase ! Money well spent ! My cat love this so much ! And he is a heavy boy but this handles him well.\n
 I bought this for my sister for her birthday for her cats!!!  It&# ;s not very stable and all it needs to be more  LBS on the bottom! the directions were absolutely terrible it took over 2 1/2 hours to put it together.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I know there&# ;s other cat trees out there that are easier to assemble.......  nothing at all was labeled on any of the pieces the directions or terrible!\n
 Ordered on  Wednesday &amp; came Friday evening with Prime 2 day shipping. Easy to put together, but time consuming only because it\'s huge. So far my cats seem to like it. We just got new furniture so I\'m hoping they will scratch at this instead. Very sturdy &amp; worth the money. :)\n
 This is an outstanding kitty tree, my cats have been climbing all over this since I put it together and they just love it. It\'s big enough and sturdy enough to hold all 4 of my cats running, climbing and jumping on and off of it, so I highly recommend. My only complaint would be that the install instructions were a bit hard to understand  as none of the parts were labeled. It would be a lot easier if the parts could have the letters A-F on them like the instructions specify. The only thing labeled were the bolts.\n
 Our cats find it so much fun to play on and it\'s pretty stable for the three of them to jump around on.  It looks nice too and not some generic rope tree.\n
 Extremely easy to put together. Soft. I was very pleased with this cat tree it\'s my second one purchased and the last one I bought was much smaller than the photo. This one is exactly as pictures and definitely worth the money.\n
 Cats like it, directions could have been a little clearer. And scratching post should be lower. A little unstable  when 2 or more cats play on it, but all and all I would buy it again\n
 This product is particle board and showed up oken.\n
 It was easy to put together and came with the tools to do that. My kittens love climbing on it and there is lots of things on it to keep them climbing and building strong muscles. They love the little hammock\n
 Cats totally love it. I have it set near a wall because my cats tend to be hyper and jump around a lot.  My bigger male cat can\'t fit in the basket but the smaller female curls into it nicely. Super soft material and sturdy. Totally worth it.\n
 My cats (2) and my friends love this tree. I have to admit that the kitties have torn up all of the greenery, but they had a good time doing it! This is solid and has lasted a LOT of use for a year now. Very happy with the product.\n
 this is amazing. Our cat simply loves this. It has plenty of space to crawl around on. The hole that is in the center we actually placed his food dish (our puppy was eating all his food) and it works perfectly. I would encourage anyone who has a cat to purchase this. Its well made and sturdy.\n
 I bought this a few days ago and it finally came in! Assembling is so easy and I am not a tool belt kind of person. Its very big so make sure you have room! It seems very stable but my cat (weighing at a whooping 15-18 pounds) makes it shake when he jumps on/off it. It hasnt fallen over however so I guess it is something he will have to live with! My cat used the little cave when it wasn\'t attached but now that\'s it is apart of the condo he won\'t go in; but that might just be preference. The scratching posts are great but the only downside I have about this is the weird angles. In the picture it looks like it will stand against a wall, this isn\'t the case but fear not! you can always take a few pieces here and move it there. Great material and the colors don\'t clash with many surrounding items.\n
 Eh there are better cat trees for less of similar quality. this one is sort of wobbly and the carpet/fur covered posts probably wont last long I can always rewrap in twine but meh</>It was fairly easy to put together and the cats don\'t hate it but if i had it to do over I would have gone with a different option.\n
 On the plus side it is huge and offers plenty of area to play on.  The bowl cutout is a nice option.</></>However, the only platform that is worth sleeping on is the very top one so it doesn\'t offer much in the terms of napping variety. Also the leaves are pretty cheap looking and fall apart quickly.</></>The packaging was also a mess and there was some damage to the product on delivery.\n
 Love it! It looks wonderful and the cats love it! My Maine Coon even enjoys jumping around on it at first it didn\'t seem that stable but I was pleasantly surprised to see it hold its own when he went flying off of it!\n
 The cats love it. It\'s also visually very nice.\n
 Love it! The leaves only lasted a year.. cause well.. cats.. but this thing is great! My cat just loves it and sleeps on it all day. It&# ;s definitely her spot!\n
 &#160;It\'s perfect my cat loves it!\n
 I\'ve had this product over a year and it\'s still holding strong. The only issue is the top most piece get\'s kind of wobbly but, it hasn\'t caused any issues.\n
 The cats absolutely love this.  They play like mad cats on it and I regularly place their toys in different parts of the tree and they are always playing on it and using the scratch posts.  I like the dark color also so it blends more into the room like furniture.\n
 This is a wonderful cat condo! It took about an hour to put together (I was goofing off with my cats during assembly) The faux fur is soft and everything looks to be made well. Instructions were simple and on point. No extra parts or weird directions that don\'t make sense. It\'s really nicely put together and looks like a nice piece of cat furniture. Love this !\n
 Kitty approved! They love this tree so much and are very active on it. It is holding up well with lots of play, however, the mouse was torn off by them in the first hour :/ The cats love the leaves, nooks and are stealth in surprise attacking each other :0)\n
 The tree itself look pretty good and stable but once you assemble and put everything together, it&# ;s not as sturdy as I thought it would be. One the arch arrived oken, which I was quite upset about because this tree/tower is expensive. I just wish it would meet my expectation for a price like this. My cat doesn&# ;t use it as much because it would always shake whenever he climbs on it.\n
 This cat tree is amazing! It is gorgeous, sturdy and easy to put together. as soon as we put the box on the floor our cat knew it was his. He loves the hammock which is one reason I chose this tree.Very impressive!\n
 We have a really large cat 20#. She had destroyed other cat trees, simply by being heavy.</>This tree has held up, and she likes it.</>Assembly is simple.\n
 Easy to put together.  Need 2 people -- as one must hold it.</>Not easy for cats to get to top shelf -- design could be improved.</>No cushioning.  Just thin "fur" on top of board.\n
 I was skeptical about this purchase, but I\'m very glad I decided to get it. My kitty loves it. She wouldn\'t even wait until I got it put together to start playing on it. It is very stable, and even more attractive than in the picture. It looks lovely. Also, the shipping was incredibly fast. I would\'ve had it yesterday (One day after purchasing), but my road was bad and it couldn\'t be delivered.  Definitely worth the money, plus more! I will recommend this to all of my friends! (:\n
 I read all the reviews before purchasing this somewhat pricey cat tree for my princess this Christmas, but it was worth it! Her present arrived early, we assembled it together with only a few slight modifications for her 13lb frame and it sits in our living room. Missy loves to race to the top, enjoys the hammocks and side perches, uses the ladder, and hides in both cubbies. While there is a slight sway to the structure when she is horsing around, I have no fear for her safety. She loves it and thinks it is one of the best Christmas presents she has ever received! Highly recommended for the purrfect pet in your life.\n
 This is such a good deal. It was easy to put together. Our car loves it. The elastic that hold the hanging mouse came off the first time the cat played with it, so I had to sew it back together. I attached another small mouse the other platform too. Overall, very good product.\n
 I have had this cat tree assembled for a little over two months and the basket area where my cat can lay has started to rip, this is a simple product defect but since it happened after 30 days there is NOTHING that Amazon can and will do about it.  I should not have to pay over $100 for a cat tree to last just 60 days.\n
 I love this perch!! I have 6 cats, 3 of them were on this before we could get if put together!! My son is 11 and he put most of it together so it was super easy to put together. The cats on it did make it kinda hard to assemble&#128513; other than that it\'s awesome one of the best cat perches I have ever had and with 6 cats I have definitely had my share of many perchces! I would highly recommend this to anyone with cats!!!\n
 Awesome cat tree!!!! Super happy with this product! Cats are loving it and it looks great in my apt! Exceeded my expectations!\n
 amazing!  If you can splurge on this you should.  My cat was an outdoor cat but due to living situations had to adapt to becoming an indoor cat.  She was miserable, and we tried a cheaper cat tree to amuse her.  The other cat tree was unstable and much shorter than this one. We returned the crap one, and we splurged for this one.  Best decision ever, love this cat tree. Highly recommend.\n
 The tree is excellent. I read in a description on this item in Amazon or elsewhere that the panels may expose to formaldehyde. I will cover the inside of the boxes. My kitty loves the tree.\n
 We recently adopted a shelter kitty.  She was not feeling well the first few days we had her and only sat inside the bottom hideaway.  After a week, though, she was feeling much better and she LOVES this tree.  She bounces all over it and  she scratches the posts which is saving our furniture.  The design is light and airy and does not overwhelm our room.  I highly recommend this product.\n
 My "little" boy is rough on scratching posts so I needed a new cat tower. The one I currently have is flimsy and too small for my ginger boy I was hoping this product was sturdy and tall; I want him to still be able to run and jump on it like he currently does. Assembling this tree, I was so happy that it is very sturdy and good quality, He and the girl love the tree and so do I.\n
 My cats love this! Was pretty easy to assemble and move once put together. My only beef with this is that it does wobble a bit if you have cats fighting on it, but I don\'t think it would come apart or fall or anything. This tree helped our girl get over her fear of heights and helped our cats finally get along better.\n
 Our cats went bonkers for the box this came in. Two days later they finally went bonkers over the tree. They\'re almost always in the tree, which sits in our front window. It\'s huge and it looks really great! Add some extra support though since the tiny screws aren\'t really that great\n
 Both our cats love this tower. Was easy to assemble, looks great, and doesn\'t wobble at all.\n
 Easy to put together, sturdy and my cats absolutely love it!\n
 I love it, my cat loves it, but the leaves ended up coming off of it.  When my cat chewed one off, I took them all off....lol</>sad since i got it for the leaves.\n
 The cat tree was easy to put together. However it is a bit wobbly but not too bad. I left off the vines because my cat would just eat them. I also left off the very top platform and small house as my cat is too big(22lb) to use those.\n
 My 4 cats love it. Its sturdy for running up and down. They love eating on the tree and it intises them to climb for excerise. The leaves fall off so i removed them. The shelf coverings would be better if it were heavier. My youngest cat is 5 years. Kittens would love it. None of mine will go in the houses or use the very top shelf bed. I compared for months. Lot of tree for the money and worth it\n
 but the cat will strip all the leaves. He was very excited as we were assembling it. Its a bit bulky but very tall, keeps him safe from the dog. We like that it has enough room up top for dishes, so the dog cant reach the cats food.\n
 Directions were very clear &amp; concise. Took a while to put together since there&# ;s so many pieces but it&# ;s very modern and our cat loves it.\n
 This is the second cat tree I&# ;ve bought from them, I will NEVER but from another company!! I&# ;m never disappointed and my bunny snd cat love it!!!\n
 This cat tree is sturdy. I have four cats two of which are full grown and pretty heavy. They love playing on it and use every part if it. I love it and so do they!\n
 Seems to be decent quality after assembled, a little annoying none of the parts were labeled, but after figuring out which was which and locking everything in as tight as they could go it seems sturdy and all the cats love it already.\n
 My cats LOVE it. They love the water dish, the top and bottom "den" and the scratching post aspect. They end up pulling the leaves off/down sometimes, but using industrial staples to attach them may help sucure them on.\n
 We have 8 rescue kitties and this tree/condo is simply AMAZING! It arrived four days early and in perfect condition. Super easy to assemble. Our kitties LOVE it! A+++\n
 We have four cats and everyone of them love this tree.\n
 Great cat tree. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. I have a 12lb cat that loves to sit at the very top. I have another 7lb cat that chases her around it.\n
 Very easy to assemble.  The instructions were very clear and all pieces were included.  It\'s in place and the cats are a little intimidated but are getting curious.  It is exactly what I was expecting.\n
 My cats simply adore this cat tree! they are forever playing/lounging on it.\n
 This is the first cat tree that i\'ve ever bought, needless to say I was very nervous about it. This tree is awesome. It looks great and is very sturdy. My little demoness  has tried her best to demolish parts of it with no luck. Highly recommend this tree.\n
 Huge and worth the money, a lot better than store ones! But only thing is its extremely hard more than than normal but at the same time you build it yourself, so it\'s not as comfy for the cats as it is from the store and that make than put into the store. Over all happy :)\n
 Very attractive, easy to put together. Surprisingly sturdy, though the hide box wobbles a little and rotates no matter how much I tighten the screws. Probably better for younger and/or more inquisitive cats. Mine were more happy sitting in the cardboard box in which it arrived.\n
 Meow meow meow meow meow meow. meow meow, meow meow. meow meow !\n
 My cat absolutely loves this, and it looks awesome in my living room, it\'s very sturdy also..\n
 I would do buiness with again\n
 This thing is great! It&# ;s very soft and sturdy and was easy to assemble. The kitty loves it and so do my boys. It even held both of their weight. Would definitely recommend\n
 We love it! It\'s easy to assemble looks awesome in the house and it\'s made with quality materials. We knew our cats would love it, but was unsure if our cat Odin woulf be able to fit in the basket being that he weighs 18 lbs. As you can see in the picture he does fit and it took him about a week or so to finally realize that he could squeeze him self into it but it works. I will definitely be buying more of these because the cats are in love with it!\n
 This package arrived several days ago, but I was intimidated about the assembly so I let it sit for a few days.  I decided to tackle it tonight since my husband is not home and will not try to "help" (interfere).  I took all of the pieces out of the box and arranged them in the bathroom floor.  It is crucial to close the door so that you do not receive feline assistance.  Do not be swayed by the constant crying of the cats.  They know that there is a party in the bathroom and they are missing out.  At first, I was irritated because I felt like some of the holes had not been drilled all of the way through the base of the box and I thought some of the pieces were different than the drawings on the instructions.  Here is a crucial piece of advice.  WATCH THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!  Some kind soul has posted a video on how to assemble this product.  The video saved my sanity.  Do not hesitate to watch part of it, pause it while you do a little assembly, rewind and watch that part again, and go back to assemble some more.  The hardest part is the "box".  Once you have that completed, you are golden.  After I finished and ought it out to the living room, the cats LOVED it.  I sprayed the cushions with liquid catnip to encourage them to explore.  Fat Cat did not fit in the box but I knew when I ordered that he would not.  He is a handsome hunk of cat, but at 22 pounds he is pretty large (he is on obesity management food and lost 2 1/2 pounds last year so I hope the trend will continue for the next few years).  There were a few skirmishes over territory (we have 3 cats) but I feel like each cat will have claimed his/her spot by the end of the week.  I have attached a picture of Annabelle (Siamese mix) and Biscotti (Baby Kitty) exploring the kitty condo.\n
 I love the look and design of the product. It was very easy to construct and my cats very much like the scratching posts. The deal eaker for me was that the poles and pads were all replaceable!</></>So,  i was disappointed to not be able to find replacement poles. The company has indicated to me that they have none in stock for a few months and to check back then.</></>So, until then,  we have an eyesore rather than an attractive cat condo.</></>I would think that other customers might feel suckered if they buy such a pricy piece of cat furniture and not be able to purchase replacements in a timely and definite time window.</>Buyers beware of this if your cats are all about scratching posts!\n
 This moldy garbage made our entire family sick including our cats who now have ear infections and respiratory issues because of the mold growth. See photos.\n
 I read mixed reviews and was hesitant to buy cause people said their cat wouldn\'t go near it! MY CAT WONT STAY OFF OF IT!! Did I mention how absolutely stunning this piece is? I just renovated my entire main level(and it looks amazing) but the first thing everyone comments on is the cat tree haha! Do buy! If your cat isn\'t interested put her on it pet her a little then let her explore:)\n
 I bought this product in September 2016. I liked this product a lot when it arrived. It is:</>- Sleek. Looks gorgeous in a modern/minimalistic house, matches IKEA perfectly.</>- Easy to assemble - it took me probably about 20 min to put it together and push it in the corner I wanted</></>However, 4 Months later, this is how it looked like (see pictures).</>I have only one cat, a 6 yo siamese and she\'s not out-of-her-mind-crazy about this tree. She\'s got other toys, beds and places where she sits/declaws but this was a great spot to feed her so that the dog would not reach her food.</>One rope is completely smashed while the other is about to come out.</>The pillow on top looks scratched and the threads are coming out of it.</>The edges of the wood got cracked a bit and look old.</></>I am utterly disappointed, more as there\'s no way I can fix this and it looks horrid.</>Too bad for the design, only if production would have been better.\n
 I liked this cat scratch climbing thing. It\'s been in use for about a month. We have five cats. All have used it a few times. It is very stylish everyone who has seen it has liked it. It looks great in the living room. The pads attract cat hair but so does everything lol. They have memory foam in them so I haven\'t tried washing them yet. Theyvget pretty clean with a lint roller. One of the bottom posts that have gotten lots of scratches has unravled a bit but my boyfriend just wound it back and stuck in another staple. One of the little ball things fell off (I\'m sure with lots of cat help) I haven\'t found it yet so I\'m not sure if it can be reattached but I assume so. My cats really like the high perch. I\'m 5\'8 and it goes mid chest, easy to pet a cat. The round pad thing comes off but the Velcro is attached to the base which was a bummer because it looks ugly if the circle pad thing is taken off. I would have liked it empty instead so I could have put a food dish or something. Over all I liked the product and if given a choice I would buy it again. We are thinking of getting another from the company. I took off one star because the rope unraveled, the ball came off, and the circle pad thing is annoying.\n
 Best cat tree around. I\'m not a fan of the "carpet trees" due to the accumulation of fur as well as the quickness my cats go through that particular material. I came across a Vesper unit in a store the first time and knew that it would work for our situation.</></>Upon arrival, I noticed how heavy the pieces were in the flat pack. There is only the need of a small tool that\'s provided during setup, but if you make sure everything goes in tight, the unit ends up super sturdy. All of the carpet pads are attached via Velcro, so it\'s easy to remove for cleaning or replacement. I was skeptical of its ability to keep everything in place with these rambunctious cats, but the velcro\'d scratch pad on top has taken a ton of abuse already and has never been torn off.</></>It did take a couple of days of snacks and catnip to get the cats interested, but once I moved it in front of the window, they were hooked. Top perch is still the favorite, though they still haven\'t used the poles for scratching or the cube for hiding, so we\'ll see how much use those particular features get in the long run.</></>Overall, A++++ would buy again\n
 My cats and I have had many cat trees over the years. We are now living with my fianc&#233; who is extremely allergic to cats and so I wanted to get something without carpeting that still had some scratching options and comfort for them. This tree is one of the good ones! The platforms are large enough for adult cats to enjoy and it\'s nice and sturdy also. One of my cats just adores the memory foam cushions and often you find him sitting on the top perch making biscuits on one now!\n
 Very nice product! You do have to follow the picture directions very carefully however. Found a couple of little snags while putting it together but really had it complete in less than an hour by myself, and I&# ;m a 68 year old woman.\n
 Great design, awful assembly. It arrived during COVID quarantine, perfect timing, right? We were looking forward to our first "cool" cat furniture. But...couldn\'t assemble the box house (which was STEP 1!) because the holes had been drilled too big - the screws just floated right through the holes. Not much we could do to fix it ourselves with the shops closed and no mental energy to fix anything with tools we don\'t own. So we tried skipping a few steps thinking, "maybe we could set it up for a scratch post?" But...the long screws for attaching the levels together were NOT THE RIGHT PART at all. They weren\'t even half the length they needed to be and didn\'t look like the graphic in the least. All the pieces of this beautiful kitty house lay in a messy pile of sadness on the floor for a day then were packed up and shipped back to the maker. Profoundly disappointed. The level of disappointment is probably exacerbated by the COVID mentality, but it was a real bummer. Our cat is just going to scratch the house carpet and laundry hampers until we feel up for trying for another. Later. *sigh*\n
 I LOVE THIS kitty tree!  It is a VERY sturdy durable piece! I bought the walnut V-High Base. The other completely carpeted kitty trees I have bought in the past may have more seating options and other cute little cubbies and such, but these never hold up for long and become loose and wiggle over time and you can\'t tighten them.  You have to just throw them out. The other ones are also a real pain to clean with that carpeting all over them not to mention how messy the carpeting looks after being scratched over time. This one is not as tall as those other carpeted ones I have bought, but my kitties don\'t seem to care. It is sturdy, of great quality and has not had to be tightened even once since I bought it about a year ago now.  I love it and it looks more like a piece of furniture. The little mats are attached to the sitting areas by velcro and could be removed if needed for cleaning. I have just simply vacuumed the mats and have not had the need to launder them. (I would think soaking them instead of putting them in the washer would be a better option mostly because of the velcro.) If kitty gets rid of a hair ball, I simply wiped it and cleaned it with a wet rag. The cubby area may seem to be a bit small for my older larger cats, but they still fit in it and love it this way.  I added a little blanket to make it more comfortable for them on the sides that are opened so they are not resting on the hard edges. They also love the sitting areas with the soft thick mats.  I even bought one for my daughter\'s kitties! You WON\'T be disappointed! You will never buy another carpeted kitty tree after owning this one!\n
 To start I purchased this 7 months ago, but it has been on backorder until this week.  Since I purchased the price has doubled.  This definitely is not worth 160$ they are charging now.  The quality is not horrible, but now matter how nice you make something look, fiber board is finer board and it is extremely cheap to purchase.</></>That being said, a star was lost because they did not sink all the screw holes,  they only counter sunk the visible ones, leaving the possibility for your pet to get their hair caught under the non visible ones.</></>The instructions were lacking, none of the wood parts had labels on them and the picture was generic showing the same amount of holes for each, so a proper validation of parts was not possible and it made the initial step difficult to determine the proper way to place the boards (side up side down).  They also used plastic insets instead of metal for the anchor holes.  These will eventually wear out from animals jumping and collapse.</></>I would not suggest purchasing this until the at minimal replace the plastic hardware with metal, counter sink all the wholes, and drop the price back down below 90$\n
 I have the same Product I bought in a store that was already assembled. The top and bottom of the box did not have the holes drilled through properly so when assembling, the screws damaged the sides. Very frustrating and the directions for assembly were not the best. Returning for a new one and hope the holes are drilled the way they should be.\n
 What I view as evidence of careless manufacturing my boyfriend sees as a challenge, so for around 45 minutes after I found myself listless and unwilling to humor the thing anymore he continued to troubleshoot and exhaust his efforts to make up for its shortcomings. He tried everything he could think of to make it work, but when the screws and screwed-out holes are all uneven sizes, there is only so much one can do. I know this is the sleekest look you can find for a cat tree within a certain price range, but to preserve your sanity, you should really consider saving your pennies and getting one made from real wood by a real craftsman on Etsy or something. This was a frustrating mess and a waste of time and money and we gained nothing at all for our efforts.</></>Also, I want to clarify that the cat tree is not manufactured in Germany like somebody in the question and answer section of this page said. It is manufactured in China (big surprise.)\n
 This is a terrible product- what were they thinking? I am so lucky I was home when my cat got the string toy that dangles from the top shelf tangled around his tail. He was left handing mid air. In his frenzy the toy then wrapped around other parts of his body. It was horrible, and I was so lucky I was able to get to him before something terrible happened. The poor thing was just dangling mid air in terrible pain. THIS product shouldn\'t  be sold to pet owners until they fix this extremely dangerous toy.\n
 Love! I was extatic to spot such a modern and more importantly, practical cat tree on Amazon&#128571; It&# ;s a bit of a splurge compared to others but it&# ;s worth it. Who says you can&# ;t be a cat lady and still have a nicely decorated home? Not this and! You can be classy and own cats&#128573; woohoo!</></>As for practicality, I LOVE that you can remove the padding to wash since all other cat furniture doesn&# ;t allow for this; which typically means you either need to get a great hand vacuum or throw away your cat tree every year or so. Not this! This is built to last and stay clean! My cats loved it as soon as it came out the box. Wouldn&# ;t let me work on it in peace &#128568;</></>The instructions were similar to that of ikea - only pictures and common sense. It would have been great if a few things were explained like what started upside down and then flipped over (because of this, the white inserts for the boxed in area are out of place on mine but I&# ;m too lazy to fix it).</></>The entire item is quite heavy - I could tell before putting it together that it would hold both of my cats no problem. Very sturdy. Thankfully I have hard flooring to slide the tree into location otherwise I recommend putting this structure together near the area you want it to stay; it&# ;s pretty heavy. Oh and I loved the rubber pads at the base to help hold the entire structure in place. Great touch &#128076;&#127997;</></>A small downfall is the tool to help put the entire structure together; it gets the job done but my hands started hurting because the screw driver wasn&# ;t catching towards the last couple turns to finish it off. My husband had all the tools I needed though so I used his which had a better handle.</></>Finally, the ONLY reason why I&# ;m not giving this tree a full 5 stars (and I really wanted to) is because one of the scratching posts, on one side, didn&# ;t have the threading needed to piece it all together to create a finished product!!! Oh my god it was the most frustrating thing ever! Most ppl build furniture from like ikea or wherever, complaining and having some kind of melt down thinking that the instructions are wrong but really they&# ;re not - no me. Not this time. I actually &#8220;lucked out&#8221; and got a defective part that had ZERO threading to finish it off and piece it all together. I was in dismay. I couldn&# ;t believe that the only thing stopping me between my pretty cat tree and my cats happiness was a screwless cat post on ONE SIDE &#128574; (I have pictures of one wt threading and one without for comparison),</></>Thankfully my husband happened to have a threader with size variations and threaded the part that needed it and voila, he fixed it!!! Oh it was amazing!!! So kudos to my judgment for marrying this man, his handiness and tools that saved the day&#128131;&#127997;. If it wasn&# ;t for him, I&# ;d be going through multiple email exchanges and waiting days to fix the problem wt a partial cat tree in the middle of my living room.</></>Best of luck to you! Hopefully my story helps you be proactive for any and all potential challenges &#128573;\n
 Quality build, easy as heck to put together, and so easy to clean. My ONLY complaint is that the "cave" box orientation requires the cat to jump up into the box, rather than facing the lower platform so an old creaky/massive cat like my big orange tabby can easily climb up into the box. I wound up drilling two new holes and turning the box to face the platform, so problem solved (it was super easy), but I would love to see this come with the option to have it turned either way. Younger cats have no issue jumping up in there, but for any over-sized or old cat, that\'s not feasible.</></>It\'s worth noting, however, that the box does not really fit a large cat well at all. My orange tabby isn\'t fat, but he\'s a pretty darn big cat (14lbs). He\'s obsessed with caves, but he gave up on this after a couple attempts to wedge himself inside. Here I was thinking he\'d fit, but as always, once I finally get whatever cave-like product I bought put down for him, I realize just how big he is.</></>I\'d say that for anyone with particularly large cats (maine coons, especially) this may not be the tree for you. My shockingly small 4lb main coone (I know, insane right?) doesn\'t even use it. I should have realized it before buying it since she\'s more of a "bush cat" than a "tree cat" (meaning she prefers to be down low rather than find high perches), she doesn\'t use the tree at all. Since my orange behemoth of a cat is old and creaky, he hasn\'t used it much either, so do consider the age of your cat. It might not be so easy for them to climb.</></>My sister\'s cats, on the other hand, are all over this thing constantly, and she put the cat food up on the top platform so her fat whale of a cat has to burn a few calories hauling her lard-butt up to the top for kibble.\n
 I wanted to like this so much but alas it does not serve my feline family well. I think the landings are too small. The middle landing does not have a pad but a small circle scratch pad, they avoid when I set them on it. I tried nip treats. Everything! no go on this. If I still had the box I would return it: I still may have to. Very pricey for what it really is. I could design a better cat tree with removable pads.\n
 My spoiled cat Helvetica needed a new cat tree. This should be a simple thing but coming from a design background I of course couldn&# ;t have the run-of-the-mill carpet covered cat tree. I literally spent over a week looking for the perfect cat tree.</></>Not only did I want something with some style I also had to find something that fit into the space I had and I wanted something with at least 2 levels. I also am not a huge fan of the carpet covered look and one thing most people don&# ;t realize is that some of these products have formaldehyde so pay attention to that. Finally, I decided on this cat tree and I&# ;m really happy with my decision (and so is my cat).</></>This is quite heavy which is a good thing. The box shown in the beginning was the first of three which is great for a cat owner. :-) After getting everything out and organized I got to work. I honestly didn&# ;t time how long it took me to put it together because I was doing a million other things but I would say it didn&# ;t take more than 1/2hr. The hardest part was putting the box together, mostly because it is the first step so I was getting my bearings. Make sure you pay attention to the velcro for the scratch pad- this will tell you which piece is the top. Also, make sure you pay attention to the square- you will want the front and back to match.</></>It is very helpful to be aware of the label on the bottom front this will help you figure out where certain pieces go and keep the picture on the box handy as this helped me a lot too.</></>All of the hardware and tools are included but I did grab a philip&# ;s head screwdriver to make it easier on me.</></>The only other thing I found difficult was trying to keep my cat away while I was trying to build this! The good news is it is very sturdy and my cat loves it. The other good news, we just got a new kitten and she is using the new kitty condo as well. I&# ;m so glad my week of research paid off!\n
 I foster kitties and so I need something I can sterilize jic someone gets sick. This is a beautiful unique cat tree. You can add carpet with velcro or even insulated beds. The scratchers are super sturdy and it provides plenty of kitty shelter even if it is extremely compact and fits in any room big or small. I will be buying from this company again and again as do far they are officially my favorite makers of cat furniture. They seem to "get" what a cat wants,  what a cat needs, what ever keeps them happy sets them free and I\'m thanking them for knowing exactly...</></>It\'s easy to put together for people who can read directions and are not me.  However, my boyfriend assembled it pretty easily. Looks like this is a perch cats will get a lot of use out of. Especially if placed next to a window. We got caves for cave dwelling cats. Perches. Beds. It\'s amazing.</></>It will really hold up against time and use too.</></>Highly recommend this to all my cat people and friends.\n
 This is my first Go Pet Club cat tree.  Honestly.... Cheap.  It looks nice but, it is scaled down.  The diameter of the scratching posts are smaller than any other cat tree I have owned. The shelves are not fully covered, (top and bottom) but I have found that with other and too. However the shelves and the bed are small and thin. The edges of the bed or perch on top are very thin almost sharp. The holes for the bolts on the bottom are not sunk in anyway making them a danger for scratching a wood or tile floor. One of the first things I noticed when putting it together is the screws on the nameplate were sharp. They caught my fingers.  I purchased a Trixie and product 4 months ago for $26.00 and the quality was awesome.  Now that I have said all of this.  I am keeping the product. I will put it in a room in the back and the cats will use it.  Since I have had many different ands of cat trees I can compare. This is an acceptable product if one did not know there is better. I will not choose this and again.\n
 The price is right; easy to assemble; and I think they like it!\n
 When I bought this I figured my cats MAYBE would use the top bed part and would definitely ignore the bottom ball "IQ" part. Turns out they LOVE the top part and one of them adores getting the balls out of the bottom toy so much I had to go buy more balls just to keep her amused. This cat tree surprised and impressed me. Definitely worth the money and then some.\n
 Took me less than 30 minutes to build it, while I was building it, the cats (I have 2) were curious and snooping around. Once it was built, one cat looked at it, played with the balls in the box and walked away, the female cat loves it, she loves high places, and sleeps on the bed at the very top, when she\'s not sleeping, she\'s playing with the mouse, swatting it.\n
 Very easy to put together by myself. None of the cats have played with the box with the balls in it... The first step could be a little longer. The top area is just right for my medium sized cats...It gets used because it\'s a great way to look out of the window or take a nap.\n
 A decent cat tree from the local chain pet center would have been $150+.  This was less than $50.  As such, it has some drawbacks.  The base is 1/4" pressboard, so there is not a lot of stability if a bigger cat wants to leap to the top shelf.  For that reason I have it aced against a wall.  The bolts that hold it together have exposed heads, so I had to mount furniture glides underneath to keep the base from scratching the floor.  The exposed bolts on top I covered up with an ancient lambskin (see pic).  The upper shelf is a little shallow, but the cat figured it out pretty quickly.</>Update 14 Aug 2020</>I just bought a roll of twine to repair what my cat has shredded on the cat tree (see photo).  He doesn\'t seem to want to scratch the center post, just the two side ones.  But those have taken a serious clawing.  I am well pleased with this cat perch.</>On the plus side, it was amazingly easy to put together.  I had it done in about 15 minutes.  The upholstery is nice and soft, but needed a few days to air out. Once the smell was dissipated the cat jumped right in.  Hasn\'t figured out the box with the plastic balls, though.  Probably a good thing, because the balls have little bells inside that could prove to be a problem at 3 AM.</>The only upgrade that I think it needs is a decent square of 3/4" pressboard glued under the base to provide good stability if the cat chooses to launch up (or down) and to cover the exposed bolts.  Other than that, I am satisfied, especially with the price.\n
 Update: Still going strong with a 3rd cat in the mix. Really a quality product. Fairly easy to clean and our cats really enjoy it. We did take the box part off because one of our cats so nicely got sick on it. But it hasn\'t affected the integrity of the cat tree at all.We have had this cat tree over 6 months it was definitely worth the money.</></>I have two young cats one is about 9 months old and the other is 4 months old and we were looking for a cat tree to put near a window that would fit full gown cats and provide carpet for scratching as well as scratching posts and this one was the best price and we felt the most bag for our buck.</></>It was easy to assemble, the bed can be turned at the top and our 9 month old kitten who is super long bodied can comfortably lay in it. The different step sections are large enough for your average adult cat to lay as well and our younger kitten has been enjoying the mouse.</></>It seams fairly sturdy and light weight as well\n
 The product arrived in a timely manner and was neatly packed with all the parts included plus an allen wrench to assemble it with.  Go Pet Club IQ Busy Box Cat Tree has a large heavy base which makes falling over not likely to happen.  The only wobble to it occurs when both of my cats are jumping around near the top of it.  Both of my cats had to check it out once I put it together.  My larger adult cat didn\'t seem too interested in it over the first couple of days.  My younger and smaller cat feel in love with it from the start.  My larger cat looked a bit uncomfortable while trying to lay in the top circular level on his first try.  However both of my cats have since fallen in love with the Go Pet Club IQ Busy Box Cat Tree.  The larger cat sleeps most of the day on the top and the smaller cat switches places with him at night.  Overall it\'s a good buy.  BTW, neither cat seems interested with the busy box despite my adding some cat nip to it.\n
 I bought this particular design (45") May 16, 2019, so my cats could get to their window table. I have multiple bird feeders on the other side of the window for the cats\' and my enjoyment. Originally their bird-watching console table had been between a couch and the window, but when the couch went the table was too high for the old cat, the fat cat and the unhealthy cat to reach from the floor. So what I needed to find was steps. Official pet steps are pretty much just for getting to a sofa seat or bed. So I started looking for something to use as steps or levels and finally found the 45" tree here, which is basically steps with the top one exactly level with their shelf/table. Perfect.</></>This does work very well as the needed steps. The basic structure has held up pretty well, despite frequent use by 3 large (I think of the black one who snuck in through the pet door a year ago last winter as small, but he is 8 1/2 skinny pounds) cats. I didn\'t think that the little bed at the top was going to get much use, but my old guy turned out to like it, even though he hangs over the edges. The toy with the balls in the box hasn\'t been used at all. But the post for the middle step turned out to be the fat old (I resemble that description myself, so no judgement) cat\'s new favorite scratching post. And in less than a year she got through the rope and the cardboard tube, to the point that the stability of the whole tree is threatened.</></>I contacted support at GoPetClub about buying a replacement post. They get points for quick response, and $10 is a reasonable price for the post, but with shipping and handling that went up to $23, or over 1/2 the cost of just buying a whole new tree. It\'s still exactly what I need, so I\'m here to order another one, ensuring replacement parts for everything but that front post.</></>So the cats will still have more and newer furniture than I do.\n
 Kitty loves it. Sturdy wood, carpet is bit thin. Busy box is sturdy and cat played with it initially. She loves sleeping on the bed up top and playing with the dangling mouse. Good price. Fast shipping. Arrived missing a screw and delayed my setting it up...but customer service was quick and efficient.\n
 This is amazing cat tower! It has very nice design, very sturdy, easy to assemble. My cats already love it! They have a lot of fun with the IQ game on the second level. It was a much needed upgrade for my home because the old cat tree is too small for my boys. The reason I chose this model is because my cats love chilling on the cat tower but they are big and they don&# ;t fit on the old cat tower anymore. This one has large shelves where the boys can sleep and hang out. I also don&# ;t like towers with houses because both of my boys like open space and don&# ;t feel comfortable in small enclosed spaces so this tower was excellent choice for their needs. The only downside is that the most part of the two long poles is covered in some cheap faic that sheds a lot and the cats will rip it apart very quickly. It would\'ve been better if the manufacturer upgrades this model and wrap the long poles in sisal from top to bottom but I guess I can do this on my own when the time comes to strip off and replace the faic. My cats are super happy! I recommend the cat tower!\n
 Overall, this cat tree is a FANTASTIC value for the money. We bought it as a cheap way to keep five rescue kittens entertained and give them more places to be during their time with us as we work to rehome them. The tree goes up easily, with simple instructions and easy-to-understand images of what goes where and how things attach with either the hex keyed, single-ended screws or the double-ended screws without heads on them.  Comes with the hex key, so you don\'t need to go get one out of a toolbox.</></>The tree is light and easy to move around the room. It does sway a bit when kittens are on it, but it appears stable and has not tipped over. Overall, we like it and so do the kittens. If we planned to keep the tree for ourselves, we\'d definitely go with a sturdier, more expensive cat tree. This one, though, will go to the home that adopts the last kittens. We recommend this cat tree, with the caveat that it may not be as durable and long-lasting as the more expensive cat trees.\n
 Our two kittens took to it like a magnet to metal. All of the different levels and toy box keeps them busy and the scratching posts are actually used quite often which is one of the main reasons we bought this, that an the incredibly reasonable price and easy setup. Assembly instructions were very clear and it took only a few minutes to setup. The large base makes it very stable. As our kittens grew to almost full size (10 months) they continue to enjoy its many distractions and levels. I was concerned that the carpet-like material covering the platforms would encourage our kittens to use it as a scratch pad. In our case, it did not!\n
 Super impressed with this. I was originally interested in this because of the good reviews and because there was a sale or deal offered through Amazon giveaways, so I didn\'t have to pay full price. I put this together with "help" from a friend\'s toddler -- that\'s how simple it was. I didn\'t pay close attention to the instructions when we were assembling it, so I had to switch out the posts I had put on with the correct ones once or twice, but it was not a hassle. My cat thoroughly enjoys it, especially the top shelf and the hanging toy, although she hasn\'t been interested in the activity box towards the bottom. I wish the overall tower was a bit more level, as it wobbles a bit, but I\'ve put it up against the wall and it\'s not a big issue. I would recommend this product.\n
 My cat has attacked this tree relentlessly, and it still stands safely.</>Personally my cat did not care about the game box, she never uses it even if there are toys in it. Knowing my cat\'s personality I would find one with a different game in the front.</>The only thing my cat loves are the scratching posts and the tunnel that she can sit in/on.</>I have owned it for about 3 years now, it does show wear mostly in the stand legs because my cat has scratched the cloth off. I could glue it back on or remove it to show the bare legs, but I really don\'t care.\n
 I have purchased other models of Pet Club cat trees before and have always been pleased with the quality. This time, much less. My cat is 14 years old and weighs 9 pounds. Jumping into the top perch rocks the unit and frightens her although happily it has not fallen over. It is stable enough as long as it it aced against a wall or the patio doors but then I have to move it out a couple of inches every time I open/close the doors. As a free-standing unit it is dangerous. I am keeping it only because for the price it is not worth the effort of taking it apart and repackaging but will also need to buy a more stable unit.\n
 I\'m really liking this product. It\'s pretty sturdy and my cats really enjoy it. It\'s tall and can be tucked in the corner and mostly out of the way depending on how big a place you have.</>I do have it against a wall since it could potentially tip over but I think that\'s the case for most cat trees.</>It took a little bit to assemble but it was easy enough.</>I\'d recommend it if you\'re looking for a good cat tree for a few cats or even just one since it\'s pretty big and good for older cats more than very young ones.\n
 Bought this for my elderly Siamese to be able to climb up to window sills and she hate it. The covering plush is a little &#8220;slick&#8221; and doesn&# ;t really allow for claws to catch and help her balance, so she avoids it. My slightly younger Siamese/oriental mix LOVES it - although it&# ;s really clearly meant for kittens or smaller animals. Both my cats are older so they don&# ;t use box toy at the bottom, so I will remove that, but they do like using the scratching areas and The elastic cord mouse. All in all, for the price not a bad unit. My only caveat is I wish it was covered in true carpet like many are - I suspect my older furry would feel safer in it if it were.\n
 This is solid and fits together well, and is pretty easy to assemble. I\'m giving it 2 stars because of poor design and small size. It\'s not a good fit for cats over maybe 6 or 7 pounds; my two are 10 and 11 lbs and didn\'t use it at all even when I hid treats all over. I\'m guessing that\'s because the platforms and little house are too small to really be comfortable for them. The angles are kind of weird - I\'m not sure how a cat is supposed to get onto the top level, since it\'s blocked by the toy box, and they can\'t really play with the balls inside the box because they\'re mostly unreachable from most of the platforms. All those holes in the top are useless because they\'re not where a cat could reach them. I think this is probably better for kittens (why would adult cats need a ramp? it\'s too steep for cats with arthritis or other issues...), but my criticisms of the toy box design still hold. Nice idea, poor design. If you have small kitties, it might work better, but I ended up getting a Kitty City cat jungle gym instead and put it in the same place. Within days my cats were all over it, and it\'s continued to be a favorite ever since.\n
 The cat house is too small for larger cats. Back when my 15.5 pound kitty was about 10 pounds, he couldn\'t fit in there. The faic that it is covered in is thin, soft to the touch, and silky. There is no padding underneath either. There have been a couple of times when he tried to run and jump up to the top quickly, slipped on the silky faic, tried to catch himself, but couldn\'t get a good hold of the faic and had fallen off. He loves laying on top, but since he is a big kitty, and it must not have been built for so much weight being thrown around on it, the top tree leans and wobbles even with screws as tight as they can go. Works okay when pushed up in a corner against a wall. Might want to screw the top section into the wall unless you want to hear it hitting against the wall as it wobbles all around when they jump on this. Would be better if sturdier and covered in a thicker, less slippery faic that would be easier to sink their claws into more.\n
 I moved to a rural area and had to change Gus the city cat into an indoor cat or he would become a snack for a coyote. Gus went mad with frustration and also went FAR more than rotund since he found less for a young cat to do in the house. He kept me awake at night while trashing the place. The climbing system (with additional plastic toys for him to toss to the floor) offered hope that he would be entertained and also maybe slim down. I worked it between some bookcases that he likes to sit on top of. At first he refused to acknowledge the addition. Kitty treats placed up along the steps helped introduce Gus to the shelving, although that did rather defeat one purpose for the climbing system. Now he keeps me awake at night thundering his 30 pounds along the wall as he attacks plastic sharks and feather toys. So yes, the system works...but beware of secondary results. Sigh. At least HE is happier.\n
 This is so great! I love it, two of my cats love it, the other is vertically challenged... she&# ;s never liked going higher than the couch. Anyway, I have bought quite a few catastrophic creations and I plan to keep buying more, I love that I can add to it, it&# ;s fairly customizable... I find myself on Pinterest looking for ideas!</></>It was awful installing, me and my boyfriend are not at all handy. I struggle hanging a picture! A few of the screws oke in half and I can&# ;t tell you how many I stripped. Also, the drill bit it came with snapped in half, there is still a piece in my wall. Lol no but I think normal people shouldn&# ;t have an issue installing this but if you&# ;re not good at this type of stuff definitely get help from someone... who knows how to use a drill haha I think our biggest problem was drilling in at an angle instead of straight so it&# ;s nothing wrong with the product or hardware it is 100% user error!  My cats love it! I plan on buying a few more plain shelves and installing them throughout the house, they&# ;re not tacky at all! My older cat, who is super timid, doesn&# ;t really trust the canvas parts (I think this is just the wood one but if you buy other ones with canvas!) she is super hesitant about going down the little canvas idge thing but she loves laying in the canvas shelf thing... geeze this review is probably super painful to read I&# ;m sorry I&# ;m awful at wording and then I probably make no sense.... my cats love it, I love it, I want more and someone else to install them lol\n
 These cat shelves exceed our expectations. My wife wanted something streamlined that wouldn\'t take up a lot of space on the floor like our cat tree had. Additionally, she wanted to be able to wash or easily switch the cushions to keep the cats\' area clean. With these cat shelves, we\'ve accomplished both of those goals. Her initial concern was that at 11" inches they wouldn\'t be deep enough to comfortably accommodate our largest cat. As you can see from the photo, though, they are perfect for him (top shelf), as well as our other other two smaller cats. Prior to purchasing them, I realized that each shelf would only be able to mount into one stud due to the framing of our home. For mounting the opposite sides, I opted for some 80 lb drywall anchors, and the shelves are extremely sturdy and secure in the wall. The installation instructions were easy to follow, and the overall quality of the shelves is excellent. Honestly, they could be nice floating shelves for applications other than cats, too. We are very happy and highly recommend them.\n
 These selves require \'stud\' which is limiting when catifying a wall...they aren\'t as sturdy as other shelves.  If used as a step, they are not bad for the money and look nice.\n
 This shelf is exactly what I hoped for--I put it on an upper ledge of a tall window. (Tried to take a picture but the lighting obscures it). My kitties jump from the top of a cat tree to a sisal shelf to get up to it, then can laze away the day watching birds and squirrels. It is extremely sturdy and can handle two cats easily. It is attractive and actually adds to the d&#233;cor. I learned about Catastrophic Creations at a local cat caf&#233; and am now contemplating what pieces to add next!  Everything was included in the kit that we needed to hang it up, and we were careful to hang it where our studs were. I have to add that this company included an extra screw, which was great because we accidentally crushed one!\n
 This shelf only took about 10-15 minutes to install, may take a little longer based on your level of construction skills.</></>Overall, great shelf and a hit with our cat right away! I needed a shelf to put under an over head window since the cat found out he could jump from his cat tree to the upper window. We did not want him to get hurt and the shelf now allows him to get up to the window safely, he can bask in the sun, and also has a new spot in the house to relax.</></>Great shelf well worth the money!!\n
 I\'m so glad I purchased this shelf. I debated because I thought I could find a floating shelf at a home supply store cheaper. However, after a couple of trips to Home Depot and Menards, the only floating shelves they had were made of plywood and cheap veneer. They also didn\'t hold as much weight as this shelf and weren\'t as wide. This shelf is real wood and beautiful and is also very easy to install. It\'s big enough for two cats to sit on at once. I love the look.\n
 The install went well and the shelves seem very sturdy. Nice finish on them as well (am using carpet tiles so the cats have something to grab onto and seems to be working well. Happy with purchase (and there had been a small glitch with my order as 2 shelves were not included in the initi\n
 I love the hidden ackets on this shelf to give a floating appearance. The kitties love it, my large orange tabby has taken a liking to the shelf and lays on it every day. I installed over a bookshelf because the kitties were climbing on my books and use it in combination with other cat shelves to give them an elevated run on the wall.\n
 Just installed one of these shelves and will be buying more. Very high quality.\n
 First off, listen to the instructions. I looked at them, then tossed them aside dismissively, only to realize that the backwards-seeming instructions were actually correct. Ah well...  The cat avoided it for a few days, prolly because of the new thing in the house smell, but she loves it. I have it near a window so she can watch the birds and squirrels from it.</></>She completely ignores the top level, so I placed a large 10" potted plant on that level. I have noticed when she vigorously plays with it, it wobbles a bit, but not in any danger of falling over. It does collect cat hair and when she scratches the posts, small bits of the rope collect over time, so I keep a garment lint thingamabobber to collect cat hair and rope bits every few days.  All in all, well worth the money spent.\n
 This should be for kittens only not for an adult cat extremely thin and not sturdy. My cats hate it. The material is very soft but super thin, So I&# ;m not really understanding how the product make her thought that would be appealing when I cat goes to scratch on this item. I&# ;m going to see if I can salvage it by adding a Sturdier base and wrapping the poles with something else. To whoever created this item thanks for a pain in the ass ! good job idiot!\n
 This is a good product for the money. It wobbles a little when my cat jumps up on it and the scratching posts don\'t seem to be in a good position for him to actually use them. But my cat lays on the top and looks out the window or naps and he is very contented so that\'s good enough for me.\n
 We were looking for two cat trees for our two cats (8.5 years old and 9 months), and we thought this would be perfect for the 9 month old kitten. We were right! He loves climbing it and playing with the attached ball on the string, which surprisingly is still attached after weeks of use.</></>The only "complaints" I have would be that it does seem to wobble a bit if he jumps on it too quickly when he has the zoomies (we do have it positioned between a wall and the end of a couch, so I\'m not sure if it would have tumbled by now without that extra support), and the hole in the second-to-top level is in a bit of an odd spot. He likes to lay down and always ends up with a limb or two hanging through it. I wish it were more off to the side to give a bit more room for kitty lounging.</></>If you\'re looking for something at a good price point that gets the job done, this is it! Attached a couple photos--don\'t have a good photo of the whole thing because of how it is positioned.\n
 Was smaller than expected. I have 3 adult cats. They don&# ;t like it because it rocks. The bed is too small for adult cats. I was looking for a cheap replacement for their older n bigger tree that they tore apart (which is what it&# ;s for). Also not a great color selection.\n
 My cat doesn&# ;t like it, but it&# ;s well made for the price, easy to assemble. Good value for the money.\n
 This was easy to assemble and my Cat seems to love it\n
 Easy assembly; good scratching post\n
 We&# ;ve had this for about a week now and our kitty cat loves it! It was easy to assemble, it took maybe 15 minutes or so to assemble. My cat loves to climb it and because of the scratching posts we&# ;ve she hasn&# ;t scratched the couch nearly as much. It&# ;s a great cat tree for our medium sized cat. The only issue we&# ;ve come across is that it shakes a little but on hard floors it doesn&# ;t. Great purchase, worth the money!\n
 You get what you pay for. It\'s cheap, so if that\'s what you want then this is the cat tree for you. I\'d suggest spending an extra $20 and getting a nicer one.\n
 I would say this product is just as I expected from the pictures. my cat is playing in it a lot!\n
 I received the wrong piece for the middle section. The holes are drilled in the wrong place.  Plus the carpet is so cheap cat is clawing wood.  $65 is now cheap but I received a $20 tree.  One more item, tree is a kittens only.  I have a small cat and it\'s to small.\n
 It&# ;s cute. Perfect size. I took off a star because it&# ;s a little wobbly.\n
 This has been perfect for my aging cat as she is not able to climb or jump as well as she used to. It is soft and inviting and she usually hangs out on the top and curls up in a little ball.\n
 Great faic and easy to build!  Our cat, Biggie Smalls is Twenty pounds loves the different levels. Top level is mall for him to lay in.\n
 Not as tall between steps than it shows.  Wish it has areas for toys.\n
 My cat likes this cat tree, tall &amp; big enough for her. A little wobbly since it doesn\'t anchor to the wall but I\'ve had it for a few weeks now &amp; it hasn\'t tumbled over.\n
 Nice looking however I would not recommend it for cats. It seems sturdy however the top perch is too small for my 7# cat to fit comfortably.\n
 Too small for my cats. Well made product though. Packing was good.\n
 Kitties love it\n
 Great purchase! My very finicky cat loves the plush bed at the top, sleeps in it EVERY evening.\n
 My cats love it.  Happy with the purchase!\n
 The cats love it!\n
 My cat loved it.  Great buy.\n
 Very disappointed...could not assemble because holes were drilled wrong on the bottom piece!\n
 My cat took a little time to decide to play on it. She loves sleeping on it and playing. Great toy for Lucy\n
 It\'s great, but could be a little sturdier\n
 It is not stable it rocks\n
 This is a cute cat tree for kittens or small cats. It was too small for my cats so I gave it to a friend who has a small cat. His cat loves it.\n
 This was a gift and they loved it.\n
 It\'s was perfect to set up next to a window for my cats to bird watch and get some sun as well.\n
 I love that it has long scratching posts, my cat uses those all the time and its not just soft padding so its not getting torn up. Its a great color and size doesnt overwhelm the room and high enough to give kitty a better view. Slightly unstable wheen he gets the zoomies and jumps straight to the top so i have little weight on the back and there is no issue!!! Recommend\n
 I don\'t know how I feel about this product... I mean Chloe Rose loves it, but now she doesn\'t want to lounge on me to get a quick nap. I\'m feeling kind of abandoned...Best-worst thing ever! (Sniff)\n
 I told myself that I would never buy a cat tower that I had to put together.  But I was reading the reviews on this one and everyone was saying how easy it was to put together, so I bit the bullet and ordered it.  I am so glad that I did!  It only took me about half an hour to put it together!  As I was finishing it up, I was thinking to myself, "Watch, these cats won\'t show any interest in it now that I\'ve put  in all this work into it!" (everyone who has cats knows what a perverse sense of humor they can have!)  Literally 5 seconds after I had finished the tower and put it into place, all three of my cats were on it and having a ball!  They love the dangling jingle ball and rope!  As I\'m writing this review right now, I hear jingling bells in the background!  If you are thinking about getting a cat tower, you will love this one!  It is six feet tall and very sturdy when put together.  I will definitely get another one of these if I need another cat tower!\n
 I really love this cat tree and so does my cat! I was a little worried about buying this cat tree online because you can\'t tell how big (or small) they are. Some of these trees seem to be made for kittens. But this tree is actually very big and has lots of space for a full grown cat! There isn\'t any of the shelves, tubes or beds that she doesn\'t fit. My cat is not huge but for a one year old cat she is bigger than most of my friends cats! She has lots of space even in the little box, which she loves! (See attached pictures of her lounging in it!)</></>Pros:</> - It is sturdy and doesn\'t seem like it would ever tip over from playing or pulling on it.</> - It is about 5 feet tall from the floor to the top of the bed on top.</> - It is really soft</> - It looks nice</> - It was really easy to put together and comes with everything you need</> - It even comes with an anchor strap for attaching it to the wall</> - Big, spacious areas for cat to play</></>Cons:</> - I\'ve only found one, which is the two upper shelves are almost the same size so it is hard for my cat to get from one shelf to the other. She almost feel the first time she tried to climb up. But she\'s found other ways to get up.</></>All in all, I think this was a great buy and recommend it to other cat lovers! So I rated it 5 stars!\n
 This was a great buy. Very easy to assemble and is very sturdy. We only have one cat but seems to be sturdy enough for several. It also comes with a strap to mount to wall for extra balance if you wish to use, we didn\'t think it was necessary but it is there if you need it. Don\'t hesitate on puchasing this cat tree.\n
 I&# ;m in love with this cat tower. I spent hours upon hours researching the best tower at the best price. We knew we needed a high tower so our kitten could escape our dogs and young kids but we also knew this tower would be in our living room and would need to look nice. After 2 weeks of use, I&# ;m very very very happy with this purchase. However soft you think it looks, double it- I could sleep on this if they made it large enough!</></>Nothing in this world is so perfect it couldn&# ;t use improvement, this tower is no different. There is a bell toy that hangs from the bed that our kitty loves. The first day we put it together (I did it by myself and it only took about an hour) our kitty got her claw stuck in the bell and began screaming. I got her free and thought it was a fluke. 3 days later the same thing happened so we decided to remove the toy all together just to be safe.</></>Even with the bad toy choice, we really are happy with this tower I will recommend it to all of my friends and buy another one if we ever get more than one kitty. I am writing this review of my own free will. I did not receive a discount or special offer for a positive review. I simply really love having something this cool in our home!\n
 This tree is pretty big. I&# ;m 5&# ;3&#8221; and the to bed is above my eye level.</>Our 16 month old cat, Kira, loves this cat tree. She got the ball off of it pretty quickly.</>Loves playing with the rope and scratching on the rope wrapped posts. Took her about a week to get to the top bed, now that is her favorite place to sleep. She just started using the cylinder and the opening above it the past few days. Wants nothing to do with the hammock. It is sturdy. She hits this at a fun and it does not wobble or top. She is not a big cat, probably 8 lbs.</>I would recommend this cat tree and I would buy it again.\n
 I was so excited when I saw the tree and felt how soft it was. Tree is for my niece and nephew furbabies and I wanted it to be fantastic for them. Started putting it together and all was going well. Until we got to the middle shelf with box and hole cutout. Carpet was glued to the wrong side of the board. Or straight up holes drilled in the wrong place to start with. This made the box attachment holes not aline up. Fixable with a drill to make a new attachment hole. But, fustrating to buy a product at a great price and then have issues with craftsmanship. Looks to be a great product otherwise. Just be ready to alter assembly instructions.\n
 Initial Review:</>My cat and I were really excited to received and put his new cat tree together today. We were almost done with assembling the pieces, when I came across the sisal post that goes at the very top connecting the top plush bed to the rest of the cat tree, and found the bolt that was supposed to be attached to one end of it just randomly laying at the bottom of the box/package. The plastic on the end that the bolt was supposed to be securely screwed into was completely torn. Needless to say, our installation came to a half and my cat&# ;s cat tree is not finished. We are so sad.</>I&# ;m kind of relieved because who knew how stable that bolt was inside the sisal post. To think that it could have oken while my cat is perched up on the top bed. I can&# ;t even imagine my cat falling off out of nowhere because of a defect in the sisal post and bolt.</>I sent an email to the company hoping that maybe they can just send a replacement part for the oken part I received. I&# ;d hate to have to disassemble it all and I know my cat would hate to see, what was supposed to be his cat tree, sent back.</></>If you purchase this, I highly advise to inspect all pieces and parts before putting it together for the safety of your cats.</></>Updated Review:</>After contacting the seller, they have been really responsive in sending me a replacement of the oken part. I received the new piece wrapped securely and was shipped all the way from China! It took over a week to receive the item, but that\'s because of the international shipping. I right away installed the top bed to the pole and my cat couldn\'t be happier! Thank you, Bewishome for being awesome sellers!\n
 Wow, first of all, it came in a very timely manner,</></>2) wasn&# ;t THAT difficult to put together, only real &#8220;difficult&#8221; part was finding the holes sometimes only because of the faic, (no biggie though because you don&# ;t want to see that infection it&# ;s all put together anyways just takes some time finding them to set it up)</></>3)it seems to be extremely sturdy! It even has a strap on the back so you have the option to stabilize it to a wall if you feel the need to. I however have not done that and it&# ;s not moved a bit! And my babies are all pretty big!</></>4) we&# ;ve never lived in a place big enough to be able to give our babies their own area, or cat tower, and sooo GLAD we can now!! They&# ;ve been kind of uncertain about it until two of my babies figured out a couple of spots, our BIG white cat weighs approximately 15 pounds, his spot is the hammock</>Our little Persian, she&# ;s always looking for a dark, hidden place, so when I showed her the condo, that was IT! She stays in there pretty much all jc the time now! She has REALLY come out if her shell!!</></>My MAIN purpose was obviously for my babies to have their own area, but, also toTRY to save my furniture and curtains lol, they are constantly sharpening their claws on my couch &#128545; I&# ;ve noticed that is slowing up a bit!! I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this!! I totally WISH I could afford another one, OR add on to it going outward to Mae a larger area for them!! Hopefully one day I can!! Thank you so VERY MUCH!!\n
 Built it with a cat insistent on &#8220;helping&#8221;.  It took about 2 hours due to fuzzy interference.</>The carpet is very thin. After having it for 2 months, my cats have already stripped the carpet from some of the pillars.  (And I clip their nails regularly).</>The top shelf is wobbly and unstable.  The twine is a very thin cord size.</></>They skimped on materials.  Given the choice, I would have chose a different cat tree and spent more money on one.\n
 I have two kittens that are just under 1 year old. They LOVE this cat tree. I\'m not a very handy person, but was able to easily put this together. Just a warning the instructions came in a different language, but every step had a picture to show what needed to be done.</></>The cloth material is VERY soft and my kittens absolutely love the feel of it and sometimes prefer sitting on it instead of with me!!!  I thought they were going to like the hanging hammock, but they really want nothing to do with it other than bite at the rope that holds it. oh well!  This is a plush cat tree and with all the ins and outs, they play on it most of the day.</></>I gave this 5 stars because it really is absolutely amazing, but there are a couple downfalls:</></>1.  The blue cloth does "shed" a bit all around the floor. It may be from my cats scratching at it or just normal wear and tear. I don\'t mind too much, but for some people, it may be really annoying.</>2. When being used by active cats, it did wobble a little bit. My cats are just under 5 pounds and 7 pounds. They would push themselves off it or wrestle on it and it would shake a bit. I ended up putting a 10 pound weight on the bottom just to make sure everything was safe and secure.</></>Otherwise, this is an amazing product and i have very, very happy kittens!\n
 I bought this cat tree for my older cat because, in my new apartment, I don\'t have any easily accessible places for my cat to be able to climb easily. Plus, it had a lot of features that I thought my cat would really enjoy. This tree assembled very easily, and I did not have any problems with the instructions. The majority of my apartment is carpeted, and I did notice that this tree did get a little wobbly since it wasn\'t sitting on a solid surface. That is not really the fault of this tree though and more of a downside of my carpeted floors. I fixed this issue by getting some corner aces from the hardware store for about $5 and using them to secure the tree to the wall. After I did that, the tree got much more stable. It took maybe a week or so before my cat finally started getting up on this tree on her own. I think it just took some time for her to adjust to it being there and to realize that it was for her. She seems to really enjoy it now, especially the little enclosed area. I don\'t really see her getting much use out of the hammock and I think the tunnel was probably designed for smaller cats and kittens, but I figured that would be the case when I purchased this tree and I was really more concerned with making it easier for my cat to get some elevation in her new living space. The only complaint that I have about this product is the bed at the very top of the tree. I thought my cat would really enjoy this because it feels super soft and comfortable and it provides extra height that would allow my cat to get on top of my bookcase if she wanted to, but since it is only supported on the top of one little pillar, it does wobble a significant amount when my cat tried to jump up to it. Since it is farther away from the wall than the back side of the tree, it makes it difficult to secure that to the wall like I secured the rest of the tree. So, until I find a solution to that problem, my cat will probably not utilize that feature. I think it would be improved if there was another column to support the bed; it probably would not look as nice, but I think stability takes a higher priority in this case. Overall, I think that this tree is a very nice looking cat tree compared to many of the others I saw, it was very easy to assemble, and it is a pretty solid cat tree with lots of nice features for cats to enjoy. Would recommend.\n
 I can happily say my kitty-cat loves this tree/tower!! It\'s very sturdy wood, easy setup, looks nice, soft top pillow/bed, twisted rope leading down to the strong tunnel, nice size bedroom, stretchy string with a ball &amp; bell, lower hammock (my kitty has never showed interest in) &amp; all the scratching posts are tuff &amp; tight. Silly kitty didn\'t know how or what they were!! It was the cutest thing when she discovered it was for her claws to knead on! For 2 weeks my husband &amp; I would scratch \'em to get her to knead. I even tried running her paws down \'em too but she wouldn\'t tract her claws. The looks we would receive was hilarious to say the least. It\'s a good price for the happiness it has ought into our lives. I recommend this 100%.\n
 I bought this in January 8, 2022 for my 2 cats. one a kitten one a small adult.  The flat part above the little boxed in area has zero support on the sides and only the two posts that are directly under the very top cat cushion bed... it is now Feuary 7th 2022.. The whole top of the tower is now leaning and crushing the boxed in area with the weight of the cats as she will lay there and bat at the little ball hangind down. This is a design flaw in my opinion as we have to figure out how to put a board or a post of some type INSIDE the "Cave" to keep the upper floor from collapsing and toppling the whole thing over. I am actually quite diappointed in the fact it has only been a month and this issue is arising .. I would say PASS on this one and go to something more sturdy ..\n
 This thing is big! However the features themselves such as the tube, cat house, hammock and top platform are a little small. Our adult cat is average size and is pretty cramped in all the features. The tube is particularly small. It\'s a little wobbly on the very top when he\'s on it. He always slept in the top of his old cat tree but haven\'t seen him do that with this one, probably because it is too small for him to comfortably lie down. But he does squeeze into the house. He doesn\'t fit in the hammock at all. This would be great for kittens.\n
 Cats freaking loved it from the moment I opened the box! I\'ve even got new holes on my for proof.. my girls helped me every step of the way! Except when I had to litterly dump one out of the square box&#129315; instructions are pictures,and I have alot of extra screws (I didn\'t put on the tunnel due to fat cats and they won\'t use it at all on the tree).. they wrestled on it not long after I finished and both fell off,and it staid up!! They found a new place to enjoy,so I\'m happy.</></>I\'m not able to upload the pictures, like AT ALL, for this product.\n
 Everything went together easily with the supplied tools.</>- Setup time was about 30 minutes.</>- Accommodates one larger cat on the second level tier and a smaller cat on the upper perch.</>- My younger cat loves the tube and hangs upside down while I play catch with him.</>- Offers a four-point steady base and is very solid without wobble.</>- Includes a nylon attachment point and hardware for customers wishing to secure the stand to a wall.</></>One CON&gt;</>- One hole was not drilled to secure the middle cat box to the middle-upper tier.  Really did not need it since the box is secured by three other bolts at the bottom.\n
 Kittens love it! Cats love it!  You won\'t be disappointed!  I did have to adjust the height of the hammock in order to keep it off the bottom level, but that was easy enough.  The large flat piece on the upper level is probably its best feature, especially if you have larger cats.\n
 Both our kittens love it and it seems this tower will be able to hold them as they grow. The only thing is the square-ish enclosure part had holes drilled for an upside down installation and some mysterious parts of the fluffy cover material came off (but we can&# ;t see from where). Other than that the light grey is the right color, the size is right and variety of features keeps them interested. The top perch platform seems to be the little one&# ;s favorite hang out spot since she&# ;s vertically challenged.\n
 Absolutely the best decision I&# ;ve made! I have 4 cats and they&# ;ve never had a proper cat tower, so when I was looking for one I found this one and saw it as the best deal for what I needed. The instructions are simple, the pieces fit together nicely and as long as you screw the pieces on nice and tight it doesn&# ;t wobble around. Make sure the top little bed part is on the tightest because I know a few reviews say that it eaks off but my 15lb cat fits on it relatively fine. The little house is a perfect napping spot and my little kitten loves laying in the tunnel and swatting at the rope through the hole. Even while I was putting it together they were laying on the parts! A little bit of catnip and they easily got used to it, and lounge and play on it all day. I&# ;d suggest putting it next to a window for the best results, because it&# ;ll keep them off other windows and counters for the most part. I&# ;ve had it for a while and it seems to be holding up pretty good, but there&# ;s always that rare chance that some of the parts might be oken, so just make sure you inspect the screws, holes and seams of the faic just to make sure it all checks out. But it&# ;s been a real life changing buy for my cats ever since I got it!\n
 My human servant made a good selection with this one. After my last tree oke (she will try to blame me but we all know she was just jealous) I had no where to sit high above my humans and judge them. This tree is much better. It is super sturdy and doesn\'t shift as I jump from the 2nd floor onto it in a death defying leap!! My human thinks the hammock is fool proof with these clips, but rest assure I will figure out a way to get it off. The plush bed at the top is the best for me to rub my head against before yeowling at the top of my lungs. And don\'t forget the bell and ball!! It was made to annoy the humans.</>I think I might puke in her shoes later tonight to show my affection.\n
 My cat was crawling up the curtains, so I started looking for a condo for him. I shopped for about an hr. When I saw one I liked I put it my shopping cart. Then I saw i liked this cat condo in my cart twice, well that\'s how I ended up buying this one. Its sturdy built n NOT one hole was off a centimeter. I emailed the company to tell them how much I liked it. The instructions do come w it. Some other people were saying they didn\'t receive the instructions. I\'m glad I bought this for my furbaby.\n
 Overall: We have two super energetic kitties and they absolutely love it! They like running around the floor day and night, but after when they got this tower they spend so much time playing and resting on it. We&# ;re even sad that they won&# ;t spend much time with us on the couch anymore! Lol</>Sturdiness: Looks sturdy enough with two kitties chasing each other up and down.</>Assembly: Although my arms hurt for couple days after assembling it, I think it was simple enough for one woman to put it together.</>Cons: -1 star because the pieces of faic started to fall on the floor in couple days. (Third pic)\n
 I bought this doohickey for our new baby, Oreo. I should have done it a long time ago. I had a cat that I loved very much. She was the best little cat. Petite, she never bothered anyone. She liked sleeping in our carport in a lawn chair and one day a husky and pit came into our carport and ripped her apart. There was nothing we could do &#128542;. She was such a good baby. About a month or so later Oreo showed up outtano where. We let the GrandPrincess name him. I bought the doohickey. I\'m hoping it will save his life!!\n
 This is a really nice cat tree for the price. The covered platforms are "fur" covered, rather than carpeting, and it is not as dense as one would hope, so it sits kind of flat, but R2 and D2 like it and haven\'t complained yet and this is nice and high so it gives them some climbing exercises that they don\'t get much of as indoor cats who were once ferals. Even R2 got up on it and she is very finicky. Think she is just trying to stake out some territory for herself before D2 claims it all. All in all, very happy with purchase and had no issues.\n
 I love having this for my 2 cats, mom an daughter. They each have their own favorite spots. As I know they don\'t mind it, I however had a horrible time figuring out the instructions. They don\'t label anything and you would think it would be pretty straight forward. It was difficult and yes usually I never have any issues putting something together but this was like Ikea stuff. Definitely worth the pain and time though. I do have to keep tightening 2 of the upper sections also.\n
 I took my time assembling this, and I think that\'s what saved me. The old woodworkers\' adage about measuring twice to ensure you only need to cut once saved me several times as I almost used the wrong post or hardware. I used the directions to double-checked myself several times throughout the process.. I used several plastic containers to separate the hardware and made a separate pile for each type of post. It wasn\'t difficult to assemble and only took me about 30 minutes. Everything was well packaged upon arrival, especially the hardware that was wrapped in plastic and taped all around. (Definitely have something to catch all the hardware as you unwrap it.)</></>My kitten loves running up and down it and no longer scratches the furniture because he loves attacking the posts so much. He loves the different activity spaces and all the different ledges, especially the top one so he can look down on me and my dog. I like to hide his toys in random places in the tower so that he has to hunt them so that he\'s engaged while also getting some exercise. The tower is very study, safe, and long-lasting.\n
 It has been a year since we had this delivered. For the prize we are happy it has lasted this long, it has definitely survived 2 active cats using it everyday, however, it would have been nice if instead of the soft fuzzy faic that has as a cover it had come with actual carpet material so that the cats could climb verstically instead of just jumping from level to level. That is why the 4 stars instead of 5.</></>But for the price we paid, it is a good deal\n
 2/3 cats used it pretty quickly, though that\'s more of cats personal preference than anything the company did. But 0/3 cats use the cubby hole, tube, nor hammock (though they like boxes and cat tunnels so that wasn\'t a consistent indicator) So if you\'re willing to spend the money for a little something extra, stick to the plain platforms and scratch areas unless you know they\'ll use such features. It\'s really sad to spend an extra 30-40.bucks and only see them use the very top 2 platforms. :( I\'d stick to this and, but wish I\'d gotten a simpler tree.\n
 I\'ve had this product barely past the return window.</>The top piece fell off with my cat on it! He fell off and landed on the floor, very angrily.</>This was assembled correctly, but the wood was simply not strong enough to hold my cat.</>My cat is rather small, but this wood was still too soft.</>This was an inexpensive product... But I\'m rather upset that his favorite spot fell off today...</>I\'ll be contacting the seller so they know about this design issue.</>Picture with cat on top is from when I initially installed.</>Lastly, the parts were pretty hard to tell apart, but aside from the manual, this tree installed nicely.\n
 I like the tree ok for my two adult cats. My problem is that they have a difficult time figuring out how to go up and down it. Especially, when on the top they tend to jump from so high up, I&# ;m afraid they are going to hurt themselves. They aren&# ;t young cats by any means and not very small either. The house or &#8220;square&#8221; could definitely be larger. They don&# ;t use the tunnel at all. And never use the hammock because it just touches the ground if they were to anyways. Unfortunately, we switched from a different tree and are not as satisfied this time around. But who knows it may be just right for your cat.\n
 Luckily it was still able to be assembled but 3 holes were drilled in the wrong spot, the condo had to be installed upside down to make up for it and the hole to balance the top platform over the condo didn\'t line up at all so I\'m worried about the stability of the bed on top of that platform. My cat loves it though. He\'s 16lbs and it supports him great. Since it was still able to be assembled I don\'t want to bother exchanging or sending it back but I\'m still dissapointed and frustrated. I just hope it doesn\'t cause problems.\n
 &#160;My cat wouldn&# ;t touch this tree for 3-4 days. Then my kids started giving him attention, and suddenly he&# ;s exploring on his own. The carpet is softer than expected and it&# ;s fairly sturdy (haven&# ;t yet wall mounted it). It&# ;s narrow so I&# ;m not sure how a big cat would maneuver it- especially getting down unless in a single jump. But plenty of places to scratch and hide, so I&# ;m happy with purchase.\n
 We bought our first cat tower in March. It&# ;s held up REALLY WELL! We have 3 cats. 2, 4 month old , 5 lb kittens and their momma @ 7 lbs.  We wanted a second one so after a bunch of shopping came back to this one and bought it again! But it&# ;s been up only a week and within a couple days the ball&amp; string fell off and the rope completely came out of the housing yesterday. I&# ;ve tried to placate contact seller directly  but to no avail. I&# ;m kinda disappointed in this one &#128533;\n
 I bought this for my 13-pound tabby cat and he is very happy about it! Loves climbing up there to lord over the dog from the many perches and cubbyholes.</>Assembly only took about a half hour, and the provided instructions were really easy to follow. Screw a piece in there, twist the posts into place, and, voila, your cat tree is complete.</></>My only note is that the base of the tree could be heavier for stability&# ;s sake, but I feel that can be pretty easily addressed by throwing a couple of weights onto it. They provide a little screw to anchor the tree to the wall, too, but if you&# ;d rather not punch a hole in your wall and be able to move it around your house at will, I think finding some cat-friendly weights are the best bet.\n
 The fur on this item is of such poor quality that it ripped when my cat tried to scratch one of the posts. The "cave" is only fur so now that has holes in it too. This is not worth the money I paid for it. I do like the styling of it and the size but would not recommend this to anyone.\n
 I like that there is enough room for both of my cats. One cat likes to climb high, the other prefers the cubby. Now she likes to drop her toys into the hole and scoot them out of the tube. It was very easy to assemble, comes with everything you need. The only thing i wish was different is for it to be more padded, it is like a faic on a hard surface, but it\'s not bad. The cats like it and I\'m happy with it. *Update - I think I like this faic better, seems not to collect hair as much and easy to clean.</>I have two female cats, one is skinny, one is chunky. The chunky one fits in the cubby. If it was a male cat that was really big, they might not fit, but the walls are stretchy faic. I don\'t think either cat has went in the tube, the skinny one might be able to, they just like to play with getting toys into or out of it. They haven\'t tried the hammock yet, I think I\'ll tighten it a little, they might try it.\n
 I have 24 indoor only rescue cats. We just recently lost our home in a flood and we lost everything but each other. Buying my cats two of these towers was one of the first things I did. We are limited on space, as we are in a temp home, otherwise I would have bought more. If we ever find a new home, they&# ;ll have several again!!</></>Just having something familiar helped relieve some of their stress, and mine.</></>These towers are sturdy and easy to assemble. They are easy to clean and surprisingly, the rope stays on pretty good.</></>The only problem they have is deciding who gets the hammock!\n
 I only have one pretty large cat, so I downgraded from my Go Pet Club three-perch, two-enclosure, two-ramp tree to this one as I figured that the previous one was overkill.  My previous tree always often required maintenance (retightening screws and ackets) and the perches were completely unpadded.  My cat loves it and uses more elements of this tree more than he did in my Go Pet Club model.  He only used to use one of the perches and very rarely used any of the enclosures.  Now he loves his new padded perch, loves the enclosure, and the open surface on the top level is also nice for him to sprawl out on.  The material is also much softer.  Easy assembly as well.\n
 My wife and I must&# ;ve bookmarked over a dozen cat trees and read dozens of owner reviews trying to find an acceptable tree that both the cats and we would love. We are very happy with this tree!</>Great faic, durable (so far after 3 months), the scratch posts are still in excellent condition, they enjoy and use each part of the tree. Both my cats are adult and above average size (not weight) and they fit in the top perch perfectly. I usually come downstairs in the morning to find them both sleeping or looking outside together. The own faic doesn&# ;t look ugly and matches our living room fine.\n
 Extremely poor staples on the top tier I didn\'t even notice until I saw a cut on my cat\'s face from it at least 4 of the Staples at the base of the top pillar were not made correctly so I\'m going to have to figure out a way to solve it and likely have to ing my cat to the vet because of this.\n
 I was concerned at the height of this for my young cat, but after putting it together (which was fast and easy-about 20 minutes total) I realized that it is very sturdy and solid. It is larger than I expected so thats a challenge, but overall this is a great tower for the king of the house. He loves it!</>The only thing I would recommend is not to install the rope toy. I found pieces of it that my cat had chewed off and I didn&# ;t want him swallowing it so I removed it.</>Highly recommended and I know you&# ;re cat will love it too!\n
 Our Belsnickel absolutely LOVES this! We shopped locals first, but they couldn\'t beat this design, and their cheapest price was $25 more than this one. This cat is absolutely nuts about it! If she\'s not running around and jumping around on it, like an absolute maniac, she\'s enjoying her perch at the top, for a nap, overseeing her kingdom. We\'ve spent much time, sitting together, and laughing hysterically, as she enjoys this. MONEY WELL SPENT! The material is very soft and fluffy, not like the carpet texture we were expecting. If I have any concerns, it\'s whether or not the top perch will last long, once she reaches 10+ pounds. Perhaps a wider base for the perch. And we purchased this model because it was the closest to all the features we wanted, but still, we couldn\'t find a model with an angled, scratching board, where the hammock is. She\'s not a fan of the hammock, and if we could purchase and install a separate, angled scratching board, in place of the hammock, we certainly would. Even if it was a special order. All in all, would definitely buy again, especially a model with a scratching board and not just posts.\n
 While this was fairly easy to assemble and the cats loved to play on it, the top part oke while my cat was sitting on it in the middle of the night. We have only had this for about 6/7 months too. He only weighs about 9 lbs so you wouldn\'t imagine that would be an issue. Luckily, he was not hurt when this happened. I have submitted a video of the incident as it was caught on our security cameras. The cats seriously loved this thing though, so we are sad to see it eak. The top part took the bolt with it so it is unable to be fixed. Disappointed.\n
 Overall, great purchase. I got this for my sister who has two bengals. They&# ;re lanky and about average size, maybe even small in my opinion, as far as cats go and the male seems to dislike the tube. The other reviews mentioned their cats having a hard time fitting in it and I can definitely see why lol that and the fact that the hammock is on the bottom.. they aren&# ;t really comfortable with that. And then the box house on the middle tier has a gap between that and the top level - which is also weird. The cats try to wedge themselves in there, but can&# ;t, so it has left us wondering why the manufacturer didn&# ;t just make the box house taller and meet the bottom of the top level.</></>All in all though, the cats really like it, it&# ;s a &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; kinda size (not too small, not too big), and the blue-grey color is even prettier than I&# ;d imagined.\n
 Easy to assemble, feels more solid than some I\'ve seen, the plushy material covering is a bit slippery and being up against hard particle board, the kittens slip off occasionally.  I would say maybe a thin layer of something under the material would pad it and make it better grip for cat claws, other than that, good value.\n
 My cat would not go near this  thing before she reached 8-9 months old, now she loves it. She goes like a lightning bolt across the room up the couch and up the car tree. I put it on a 2 foot tall end table now the top bed is about 18 inches from the ceiling and cats love to observe from above. Update 10/25/19 Cat still loves it but accessories are wearing out, the hanging rope is completely frayed and she ripped the hanging ball off. Would be nice if the accessories could be replaced.\n
 &#160;It&# ;s super cute and exactly like the picture but the very top piece is not super sturdy. It&# ;s very easy to assemble. My cat is 13 lbs and about 18 inches in length (not counting her tail) she&# ;s able to sleep on the top platform comfortably :) however my cat can barely fit in the small little &#8216;room&# ; and also the tunnel&#8230;my cat&# ;s a little overweight but if you have a smaller cat it&# ;ll be perfect for them.\n
 Highly recommend. Great price for the product. I had no issues putting it together and I hadn&# ;t even had the first part of the instructions done and my kitty was already wanting to play on it. She patiently waited and played till I had it done and then she didn&# ;t want to get off of it. I really like that they offer so many colors too so you can match it with your home decor.\n
 It looks good and with two kittens it has everything in one place a hammock, tunnel, multi levels with toys along the way, a house when they want and two levels on sunning as t sits by one of my front windows. Lots of scratching posts too! All for a very reasonable price. Word to the wise make sure you tighten all of the fittings Very tight...tighten, take a eak then tighten again!\n
 Just got this new cat tower- in the photo the new on I just put together is on the right. My old, well cat loved one on the left I got at Petsmart about 7 years ago and I included it in my photo for comparison. The new one was very easy to put together- I would be careful not to overtighten the screw together joints or you could risk popping out the metal connectors. Theres really no need to over tighten it anyway.</>The carpet appears to be similar to the carpet on my original tower. Some reviews I read prior to this purchase stated that their cats shredded the carpet- well guess what???? Thats what cats do and its better they shred on the tower than your precious couch&#128521;! Let me repeat that- cats love to shred on carpet! You can sprinkle a little catnip on this to help train them that this is their space to shred away! As you can see in the photo of my old one it is well shredded- you can take scissors and trim the frays from time to time if needed and the rope can be replaced as needed also. The lower perch on my old fell off last week- its fixable- just need some screws.</>Some reviews also stated their cat could not get up because if the configuration of the perches- then something is wrong with your cat! Cats are natural climbers and mine are like flying monkeys racing up and down the tower! My male is 18lbs and has never knocked the original over even when he is having major road rage- it will teeter a little but it always rights itself. Really stable and sturdy- this new tower appears to have the same building sensibility put into it.</>Just out if the box I am happy with this purchase  and would recommend it to a friend!  This new tower cost me about $40 less than my original one on sale at Petsmart for $180. So that was a plus!  I will update how it goes in the future if anything comes up.\n
 One post wouldn\'t screw in tightly and was unstable.  Top perch wouldn\'t screw in tightly-you could spin it around like a bicycle wheel.  Even though the tree is heavy, it wobbles a lot!  My cat would never get on a tree like like this!  The sisal is attached with staples.  The staples stick out and are extremely dangerous dangerous!  Your cat could catch it\'s nail and that would not end well.  Do not buy!  I wish I could give it zero stars for a rating!!!\n
 Easy to put together &amp; very good looking tree but...... like many others, I too received a tree where the tunnel &amp; seat were drilled so close together that it makes them lean into one another. I also didn\'t realize that since these levels are placed upon one pole stand and not two, this makes the tree shake when the cats are on it. My older Siberian doesn\'t fit very well on the tree and gets scared when it starts to shake, but our baby kitten loves it.\n
 The bolt does not screw into both. It only screws into one side. The ridges on the other side don&# ;t work.</>This was a used product. What they forgot to say is that one tower doesn&# ;t screw in to damaged machine screw bolt. Took $14 and several hours to identify problem and make new parts fit. But it works now and cats love it.\n
 Absolutely love it. I bought other ones and returned them because they weren&# ;t sturdy, this is sooo sturdy for my cat, I love it....</>I have a 18lb cat that loves to fun up his on and needed one to do that... he&# ;s in love.</></>&#8220;People, it is fantastic&#8221;.\n
 My cat stopped using his previous cat tower because the cardboard was weakening and he didn\'t feel safe.</></>He\'s a big cat (18 lbs)  and I know it tipped over on him once.  So, I spent a good deal of time searching for a good solid tower when I found this one.  I was sold on the "solid wood" and manufactured in the USA.</></>Once I put this together, I noticed it was shaky, not sturdy. The partially covered round perch gave way when my cat tried to use it, then he stopped again. It was loose, so I had to unscrew the other post with the highest perch first before I could fix it. I tried screwing the rounded covered perch all the way in but it was never tight enough until the opening part of the circular perch was facing the other post.  Certainly that won\'t work, my cat wouldn\'t even be able to get in &amp; out of it!</></>It was a horrible struggle, but we managed to put a thick cloth around the post that connects to the other sisal rope post.  That was the ONLY way to get it tight enough to be stable. After all that, now the whole tower wobbles from the very base. It seems the very bottom platform and connecting posts should have been configured smarter, differently, to offer more stability.</></>On one side especially, if my cat were to run and climb quickly to the top, it will tip over.  The base is way too short with less than desirable positions for the posts.  So now I have to see about anchoring it to the wall for the kind of "sturdy" you advertise.  So much for "Made in America."\n
 My cats loved this tree, and in principle, it\'s the best one out there for design and durability. But it seems there\'s a bad batch in stock at this point, and I\'ve replaced it twice now, hoping for one that hasn\'t been returned already. But no joy. The posts are attached at an angle to the base, which is itself warped and unstable; the staples used are 3/8" and meant for paper, NOT carpet, so they pop out and are dangerous to the cats; and the phone number for customer service is routed to nowhere, directing that all contact be through email, which never elicits a response.  True that some negative reviews lack common sense, but I wish Amazon could take more responsibility for quality control of the products they sell.\n
 My cats use it and seem to like it enough, but not nearly as much as their other cat tree, and it\'s not just the placement in the house. The tube with the "window" is definitely awkwardly placed. They have to either crawl out the window to get to the top, which they rarely do, or scale the opposite side of the tube, which they do frequently. They don\'t have quite enough footing on the tree for scaling the other side, so there is a lot of struggle and clawing their way to the top. My cats are young, so it\'s not really problematic (and a little comical), but I could see it being a big issue for older kitties that want to be in that high perch. Even my young cats mainly use the scratching posts and the second level perch. It is pretty sturdy, as long as you have it on level ground and it  does look nice. Super, super easy to put together and all my peices fit. The top nest is nice and deep, which my cats also like, but I feel like they don\'t use it much because it\'s difficult to get to. With two cats trees, I\'m happy with this, but would consider a cats abilities before purchasing.\n
 The updated new model in ivory was so easy to put together and easier to move than the last model, which was all in one piece. The cats had claimed it and were sitting in it before I could put it together! They insisted that I keep the old battered one as well, so now I have one in the bedroom and one in the living room and they romp between them. I recommend this company\'s cat trees very highly, and so do Apollo and Cecily!\n
 Max is a big boy so I needed to find something that would fit him comfortably and wouldn&# ;t topple over when he climbed. This is so sturdy and strong! Max took to it immediately and is so happy. This is where he perches and looks down on us little people; king of the world! Haha! He loves the carpet to scratch and being able to jump around in the different levels gets him frisky. I couldn&# ;t be happier with this purchase. I&# ;ve bought towers before that are fake wood and light duty. This is definitely not one of those. Great product, won&# ;t buy anything else now.\n
 This was SO EASY to assemble! It\'s very sturdy, and well made. I had dreaded putting it together so much, that it sat in the box for a week. After removing the parts from the box, and the cats from the parts, it took less than 5 minutes to assemble. The cats all love it, and they have staked out their new property. Very popular!  It has gone over so well, I bought another one! New Cat Condo\'s are GREAT!\n
 Well,  I am giving this cat tree a second updated review.  Actually, if it had not been for the problem with the parts screwing together securely I would probably have given it 5 stars. But it took my son a lot of work to get it to be secure.  Still, it is a great cat tree, nice and tall and heavy. Well made, other than the screwing problem. Anyway, my BabyKitten utterly loves it.\n
 I love the style and height of this cat tree. My cat loves it too....his favorite is the enclosed oval. Unfortunately, the material is cheap. All the carpeting is coming out and there are plastic strings all over the place. For the price, I\'d expect higher quality.\n
 Very big, solid, sturdy. I did a lot of research before buying and glad I did, it&# ;s not the best looking cat tree on Amazon but it&# ;s definitely great quality (from what I read the more stylish ones fall apart quickly or don&# ;t fit the function of a cat tree, this one has a perfectly placed scratching post and great heights to climb). My cats are not a year old yet but this will fit through to old age.\n
 I got this for my 14-15lb cat. It&# ;s been 2 days now and he hasn&# ;t been wary of it at all and surprisingly, did not freak out because something new was added. He immediately sat on top of the stuff to explore when I opened the box. He seemed more interested than put off by the smell and started rubbing on everything. It took me 5 minutes to assemble, but an hour to disassemble the top perch from the pole. I decided to take off the top bed but keep the pole because there wasn&# ;t much space between the bed and the top of the tube for my cat to stand up or have the ability to jump up there. I kept the pole in case he wanted to scratch on it. I&# ;m very happy with the size of the tube and the beds. The tube is big enough that he only has to crouch a little to stand, and he is easily able to turn around in it without having to stick his face out the window. I think the window of the tube is big enough that he could climb through it if he tried. The other perches can very easily hold him without him spilling out the sides like on his old tree. There is even extra room for him to spread out on the middle one. The only thing I&# ;m disappointed by is how close together the middle perch and the tube are. The tube slightly hangs over where the middle one is which means there isn&# ;t as much room for him to jump. It&# ;s fine for getting inside the tube but I&# ;m not sure if he&# ;ll be able to jump straight up to get on top of the tube. I&# ;m keeping his old cat tree next to the new one as a platform to jump off of for now but maybe he&# ;ll get more comfortable in the future. Overall I really like it and he will already jump onto the top of the tube if he&# ;s interested in a toy up there and I&# ;ve found him napping on the middle and perch once already.\n
 This condo is covered in real carpet which is easier for cats to dig into when climbing.  It has multiple layers for lounging.  The base is not heavy enough for free standing.  It needs to be wedged under a piece of furniture, like a sofa, to keep it from falling over when cat jumps high.  I have ours up against the wall between the tv table and a bookcase.  With a heavier base shipping would cost more, so I am happy with my purchase :)\n
 Very well made. It&# ;s nice and heavy so no fears of my 16-18 lb cats knocking it over. I needed something for older cats. Not tons of little hiding spaces and toys dangling. I especially needed platforms large enough. So many cat trees cater to kittens. But what about when your cat is full grown and won&# ;t fit in the houses, hammocks or on the multiple small platforms??  I highly recommend this tree. It was also extremely easy to assemble. You will probably need help getting the box in the house and out of the box.\n
 I like the carpet and it feels sturdy. My cats wanted to jump on it as soon as they got done playing in the box it came in!  But it arrived oken. The hardware for the top platform is bent and smashed in so I can&# ;t attach it. It&# ;s built in to the platform so I can&# ;t even replace it. My cat tower is now 55&#8221; tall. It&# ;s very heavy so is it even worth it to box back up and haul to ups to return? This one took weeks to get here as it is.\n
 I was so happy this came in three pieces and I just had to screw them together. The height is perfect for my home and my cats, and I really like the color too. It&# ;s very sturdy and is made of good quality materials.\n
 I have 12-year-old cat and 13-year-old cat and within 10 minutes of assembling the cat tree they were all over it one of the reasons I got it is because it has some low platforms so it would be easier for the older cat but he was able to get up to the top easily. It took about 10 minutes to assemble it and it seems quite sturdy I would definitely recommend this kind of cat tree using solid wood and real carpeting means that it should hold up for quite a long time.\n
 &#160;I like that it\'s real carpet, my cat enjoyed it right away. It does wobble alittle, due to carpet just folded under and stapled on the bottom. If carpet the whole bottom, wouldn\'t wobble. I like it alot, but very pricey.\n
 The cats love it!  Gave 4 stars because of the cheap carpet.  After 2 days I have a pile of carpet shreads at the bottom.  Carpet won\'t last long. I would gladly have paid more money for good carpet.\n
 &#160;Bad quality, they used the cheapest carpet, color is different than on pictures, and after two months it&# ;s oken\n
 Quality of the rug is very disappointing compared to others we&# ;ve owned especially considering the price.  They aii shed tufts as the cats scratch so I was willing to over look it, hoping it would decrease over time.  However, other problems have ensured and the tower is now out doors, on the back porch. We are awaiting information on blood work as the cat appears to be allergic to something in/on the tower.\n
 Bought for my son&# ;s very active cat. That cat loves this tree! They have a very high window ledge and this tall tree is perfect! He can lie in comfort and monitor the neighborhood or easily transition to the window ledge if he needs to.</>Easy to put together and sturdy. Great product!!\n
 The New Cat Condo cat tower is very well made.  Sturdy wood construction covered in strong carpet.  Well worth the price.  I expect this to last years!\n
 This cat condo is very sturdy &amp; solid.  The carpeting is attached well &amp; isn\'t peeling off the posts.  My previous condo was shredded after a week or two.  This one has held up very well &amp; my three cats love it\n
 Well built and sturdy. My cat loves the height and spent almost all day on it the minute my husband put it together.  He gets very possessive and doesn\'t want us coming near his castle!  He likes to swat at us through the window in the tunnel.\n
 I was in paradise it was so easy to install\n
 Easy assemble after I got the big box inside(heavy).  Unit is very sturdy and durable.  Cats love and it is holding up very well.  It did not come with a safety strap for securing to a wall.  Great value for the price.\n
 This cat tree has great carpet, solid wood, and easy assembly.  Had a wicker basket nice cat tree but cats did not like it so I sent it back.  Cats love this carpet which is plush with only minor strands (4) that were easily cut off.  This cat tree is basically one unit with the upper loft attached by twirling to the post.  The tree was well packaged, weighed about 50 pounds.  There were no missing parts and alignment was true.  My cats were on this tree within 30 seconds after assembly.  It seems stable and the circular loft is about 17 inches, which is big enough for my 20 pound grey and white fluff ball.  There is carpet underneath the circular loft, which is about 32 inches from ground and will reach window pane. There were no strong odors.  Prestige Cat trees are well made and will last forever.\n
 This cat tree doesn&# ;t allow enough spacing or offset for my cat to comfortably jump from one shelf to the other.  My cat is only four years old and quite a climber so I imagine if she&# ;s having issues a lot of other cats will too.  Frankly I would return it if my husband hadn&# ;t already disposed of the shipping box.\n
 I have two very active kittens. I bought another cat tree for them and I was always worrying that they\'d tip it over. When I saw this one on line I immediately realized it would be much more stable. It\'s great! They can wrestle all they want on it, jump from the top to the top of bookcases, or just plain sleep comfortably curled up together. I love it and so do they.\n
 My cat loves his climbing towers. He has recently showing signs of arthritis in his back legs. Having multiple levels has made it so much easier for him to still climb up to the top where he likes to be. Very sturdy also which helps a lot since he&# ;s 15 lbs and very long.\n
 I have a rather large cat and some of the cat trees do not have a sturdy base. This cat tree is made very well and attractive . Very pleased\n
 I see pictures from customers of the tree with beautiful carpeting from a few years ago and mine is not that. If you purchase it now they have switched out the beautiful plush carpeting for carpet so cheap I wouldn&# ;t even put it in my garage. I have been buying cat trees from Prestige and New Cat condos for years and both companies have gone way down on the quality of carpeting on the trees. Did they think we as the consumers would not notice this?! Is carpeting that much money that you can&# ;t put plush high quality carpeting on the trees like you advertise yet still charge us the same high amount?!? Order from either of these companies and you will see for yourself. I never write reviews but I felt I had to here.\n
 Easy to assemble.  Wish it was a little larger.\n
 One of the best and solid cat posts I&# ;ve ever owned!!  It is sturdy and won&# ;t fall over!!\n
 I needed something strong enough for my 15 lb cat and her super active other. This cat tree fits the bill!\n
 Liked very much\n
 I\'m usually lazy about reviews but am writing in hopes of helping more products like this flourish in the market, because we really need more of this stuff. My dislike of carpet and faux fur limits my options greatly, and this cat tree is a godsend.</></>- The gray slate wood is lovely and looks better than most human furniture in my house. Not only is it beautiful, but it\'s also more affordable than most other carpet-free cat trees that are simpler in design. For the price, this is an incredibly high quality piece of furniture to spoil your cat with, and even comes with a full sized screwdriver and easy-to-follow IKEA-style instructions.</></>- Unlike most cat trees that have open top perches, the rounded and walled top perch on this cat tree allows my cat to curl up and lean safely. The hanging toy is a bonus that allows the lazy cat to become a little more active.</></>- Kudos for the little pad you can velcro onto the wood surface so the cat doesn\'t get cold while we still get pleasing aesthetics. The faic has the pleasant feel of flannel pajamas.</></>- The bottom box is quite low, and comes equipped with a thick, fluffy cushion - perfect for an aching senior cat. Bonus points for the cushion being removable.</></>- The proportions are well balanced; minimal lines, tucks nicely against your wall or corner, offers plenty of height without being overwhelming, while packing very diverse resting areas -- a safe little nest to snuggle in, an open space to groom and lounge, and a top perch to curl up or bird watch. It meets all my cat\'s needs and she stopped using any other bedding.</></>- Each resting surface (top perch, velcro pad, box) fits a petite cat with a bit of room to spare. For our 8lb cat this is a deluxe condo with plenty of surface area, but if your cat is 22lb, it\'s gonna be a tighter fit.</></>- One of the side boards to the enclosed box came with a deep crack that threatened to eak off the entire length of the box. We stabilized it by putting the other parts together and fastening them to hold it in place. But if not for this workaround, we would have had to go through the hassle of a return process after having spent half an hour dealing with the assembly, and the frustration would have dampened our spirits about this considerably.</></>- Some of the holes for the screws were not uniform.</></>- Due to its many parts, it\'s inevitably less stable than a solid piece of furniture. The highest perch, for example, wobbles a bit when my cat moves.\n
 My cat took to this tree immediately, and spends a lot of time snoozing on the top perch. It looks exactly as advertised and is very aesthetically pleasing. I was able to assemble it relatively quickly, and I am not talented in putting things together at all. I actually got a few things wrong at first, and was still able to get it all put together in about an hour. It\'s sturdy, doesn\'t wobble at all when she hops onto or climbs it (and yes she has climbed the scratching post a few times), and the dangle toy is still intact! So far, she hasn\'t used the cubby yet, aside from poking her head in at first exploration, but it takes her a bit to take to enclosed places.</></>Overall, a very nice looking cat tree/condo if you\'re looking for something of a more reasonable height and have a single cat.\n
 I do not enjoy and am not good at putting furniture of any kind together. If I found it easy to assemble you will too. I was happy it included a screwdriver. My kitty is declawed so she doesn\'t use the scratching posts. She is 13-14 pounds and it is sturdy. She loves the toy it came with (there is an extra one included which is nice). The color is what you would expect.  All the positive reviews made me purchase it and I am very happy with it! The measurements are accurate. I think it an excellent value for what it costs.\n
 Absolutely love this cat tower! Wanted to buy something a little shorter to be placed in front of a window for my cats to people watch. They took to it really quickly and have really loved sun bathing on it during the day. I think it&# ;s a great size overall to give them plenty of space. It&# ;s very ascetically pleasing which I love compared to a lot of other towers. The one thing I would say for construction- the piece of the cubby with the hole for them to get in (at least for me) was cut so that it had to be put in a specific way to fall flush with the rest. It&# ;s a square piece but I guess not technically even. I don&# ;t think it was mentioned in the instructions there was a certain way to slide it so then I just realized that turning it and putting it in differently was what to do. So not a big deal at all but just something to know if putting your piece in the first time makes it not fall flush.\n
 This was very easy to put together. Did it in a 1/2 hour. The second I finished, my cat got up from where she was and jumped into the cubby hole. The height is perfect for my window which is 40&#8221; from the floor. She also uses the scratching posts regularly. I like that it isn&# ;t made of carpet. The base  and top perch are made of faic but won&# ;t leave carpet fibers all over. The cushion for the cubby hole is a little flat so I just put in a blankie on top of it to make it softer. Happy cat. And isn&# ;t that all that really matters?\n
 I like this thing. It was easy to assemble, it looks perfect in my house. My cat is 4 y.o and  has never had anything like this before, so he was freaking out for a little bit, but started liking it very soon.\n
 It&# ;s sized for kittens. My cats don&# ;t fit in the cubby or on the top shelf. It&# ;s not comfy or enticing so they don&# ;t use it at all. It looks better than most cat trees but not useful or practical\n
 &#160;I&# ;m am just thrilled with this product it&# ;s the purrfect gift for my two new kitties. They play on it all the time. They were hiding under furniture often before I got it. I also love they won&# ;t scratch on my furniture as much. My 15 year old granddaughter put it together easily. it&# ;s so pretty. I read the reviews on many other one looked very cool but had a review saying a cat got its paw stuck in it. this is the best bang for the much and love the contemporary look.\n
 This product is VERY well made.  The materials aren\'t cheap -- they went above and beyond making this product.  They include a full-sized screw driver to help you assemble the product.  I had a lot of fun building this cat tree!  It\'s cute and fits well with my furniture.</></>My cat hasn\'t taken to it yet -- she is more of a burrower than a climber.  I just needed something for her to scratch on and possibly get used to hanging out on it than laying in my new recliner and scratching that up.  :)\n
 This is a great product! Very easy to put together, and it comes with everything you need, even a screwdriver. The height of the top perch is perfect for my cat to look out the window. My cat is just under 10 pounds and fits perfectly in the cube and on the top perch. If your cat is much bigger than that, I would recommend finding another product. It\'s a tad wobbly, but pushing it against a wall was enough to stabilize it. The toy ball that comes with it entertained my cat for about an hour before she snapped it off. But still very much worth the price!\n
 I spent ages shopping around for a cat tree that was aesthetically pleasing, or at the very least, palatable to look at in my living room. My cat has FOMO very badly, and would never use a cat tree unless it was in the main living space. This tree is modern and cute, but blends in with my decor style. It was easy to build, I think it took 15 minutes and I was chit chatting as I worked on it. My cat is on the heavier side, but does fit in the top perch. If you have a large cat it might not be a comfy fit.\n
 Love the modern look of it, it is much more attractive than most cat trees. My two cats absolutely love it, and love that there are multiple places for them to lay comfortably. It is sturdy. My one cat who is rather fat loves the little box that she can crawl in and fit comfortably inside.\n
 Super cute, modern cat tree. We have a smaller sized cat who weighed (prior to the Covid) about 8lbs. She is compactly in the areas for her and she has enjoyed it since putting it together. Our 11 year old son, who loves anything to do with building or tools, put it together with ease.  Looks great, just as the picture and we are pleased with the purchase as it goes well with contemporary decor.\n
 I first bought this cat tree and then also bought a taller one by the same company. The quality of both is great and they are super easy to assemble! The cubby is on the smaller side and fits one cat great but is a little tight for two, even tho my older kittens still smoosh themselves in there. Highly recommend this!\n
 Most cat trees have never been updated in style. This is one of the few modern looking ones.</></>Super easy to assemble. Someone with basic skills could probably do it without having the instructions in hand... it\'s that easy to figure out.</></>I like the removable pad and pillow... Makes cleaning MUCH easier than the carpeted ones.</></>VERY happy.\n
 Our kitten absolutely loves this cat tree. He loves jumping up each flight and laying on the top perch looking out the window. The only annoying part was it came slightly damaged (see attached images) with a chip in the wood, right in the front of the tree in perfect view. We waited so long for it to arrive we didn\'t want to spend all of the time it would take to return it and purchase a new one. Otherwise, it\'s great.\n
 Okay, so the baby girl absolutely loves it and actually uses all parts lol.  I would have like it to been taller but just stacked it on something I already had and added some of her favorite pillows and rest things.  She place with the having ball thing every single time she jumps up onto it, multiple times a day.  She will spend hours sleeping there.  Seriously. See image\n
 &#160;I placed it in the bedroom for access to the chest &amp; window.</>My 20lb boy enjoys it.</>He sleeps in the top part, too.</>My other 11y.o cat does not use it.</>Wish it was a bit shorter for her to jump on.\n
 my cat really loves this tree. it\'s super sturdy (she\'s 10lbs) and she loves to play with the little ball on it. she\'s a little big for the top round perch but she doesn\'t seem to mind as she\'s always up there lol\n
 Great little cat tree for the price. I was able to put the pedastal on the opposite side which was nice.\n
 My persian boy loves his new tree/ condo as we call it. So chic and we\'ll made. He loves the top round bed he lies in it more often than the box near the bottom even his fat Garfield lookin self kinda hangs off the sides a little haha he gets the zips and climbs up and attacks the toy. And I love how the toy screws in and comes with an extra toy as well.\n
 I really liked that it was modern looking and not covered in all that outdated beige carpeting stuff, either. My little fella was climbing all over the kitchen counters, so wanted to get him something else to climb and this has done the trick so far. Unfortunately, he doesn\'t use the enclosure, though, so I wish there was an option for another scratching post and shelf or something else in it\'s place. However, regardless, it was still a great find and I\'m very pleased with it.\n
 This product is pretty cool. Nice cat furniture, with fun modern appeal. Easy to put together. Relatively sturdy,  jury is still out on the top platform. But our 2 yr old cat loves to sleep up there and its holding good so far. Our kitten likes the bottom. :-)\n
 It was easy to put together (very similar to other furniture assemblies). I have two cats and they have both enjoyed it very much. It&# ;s more modern looking and the perch seems to be the favorite thing. If I could change one thing, I would want the cat scratching posts to be slightly thicker in diameter, but they still use it.\n
 I was really excited pulling the pieces out of the box. This is the most modern and simple cat tree I&# ;ve come across and I was delighted as I assembled the pieces. Unfortunately it wasn&# ;t until the very last piece (top perch) that I was disappointed the hole was too big for the screw so it can&# ;t screw into place. I am now left with an awkward cat tree ;(\n
 My cat is finally relaxed.  My puppy irritates my cat so bad she was running out of places to jump on. I ought her this and she\'s in love...it sits by our screen door so she can look out at nature and don\'t have to worry about our puppy.\n
 My cat loves this! We have a small apartment and wanted a cat tree to put in front of our window that wasn\'t too big or too much of an eyesore, and this accomplished that! Our cat likes sprawling across the second tier, and sitting on the top level to watch birds. She also loves the little ball! Great product, thanks for keeping our cat occupied!\n
 Easy to assemble. Sturdy as all heck. Came with clean parts, everything setup nice. Couldn\'t be happier with this purchase. Perfect for my young cat, she loves it!\n
 The cat tree was super easy to assemble. Everything was labeled and the instructions were clear. I like the modern take on the cat tree, really blends in with my furniture. Doesn&# ;t take a lot of space and my cats really like the resting hole.\n
 My cat likes it. I wanted something smaller and modern. The cushion on the top is a little small. Overall it has a clean look. My cat is used to a tall bigger one but, this was a good compromise for a new one in my apt.\n
 Bought for my upstairs. Cats really like it. I forgot to click on the $5 off coupon, so don&# ;t forget!\n
 My cat loved putting it together. Although now he just visits it but he does use the scratcher all the time.\n
 Well made, perfect for bigger cats.. our fatty loves it!\n
 So amazing</>I LOVE the look</>I love theres no ugly Carpet</>So cute</>Really really amazing material</>Even comes with a screwdriver and extra of EVERYTHING\n
 The lone tower piece makes me cat feel a little uncertain when she gets up there, not her favorite place. But overall I love the look and design of this.\n
 MY cat loves it and I\'m so glad I made the purchase. Sturdy materials with sleek design. I think it\'s a great value and now want to purchase another. It just blends right into my decor and gives my baby a place to get away from the doggies.\n
 It took a little while to assemble but it was pretty easy. My Bengal and Ocecat love it! &#128571;&#128571;\n
 The thing oke in half after only a few months of use! Scared my cat and my toddler  when it oke too!\n
 I wanted something that looked a little more modern and had the colors of our living room. This was perfect! The cats seem to really like it!\n
 This cat tower was just the right height. My kitten loves to look out the window on the highest tower bed. It was fairly easy to assemble, I would use a drill to really screw everything in to add to the sturdiness. My cat loves it and the color is great and modern.\n
 so easy to put together, came with all the tools and parts as well as some extra pieces and a replacement ball toy! My cat is obsessed.\n
 Absolutely LOVE this. So happy with my purchase. Very sturdy and only took 15/20 mins to assemble!\n
 As soon as I completed putting the tower together my cat made it her own. Perfect size for my apartment. I didn&# ;t use the circle opening for the cube but left it open. Also attached a piece of sisal to the outside of the cube for an additional scratching area.\n
 Sleek, sturdy, and functional.\n
 My 7 pound cat loved the tower. After several weeks, the seat tower became wobbly. My daughter tried to tighten it and the cardboard structure under the scratch post oke. This made the seat tower useless.\n
 Our vacate love it. Comfortable extension of their window view\n
 This is a beautiful cat tree. My 2 cats love it. Very sturdy and the price was fantastic. Definitely recommend.\n
 It looks really good after assembly. It is easy to assemble and my cat immediately started using. She isn\'t a large cat so I\'m not sure how the tallest stand would be for a bigger cat. She enjoys hanging her head off and sleeping.\n
 Super pretty! My cat loves the felted material! Doesn\'t look like a cheap carpet!\n
 My 5 lb kitty loves this piece. She perches to watch the birds and naps in it during the day and at night. I like the scale for a small cat and the more modern design works well in my bedroom.  It is very well made.\n
 This was super easy to assemble and a the best looking cat tower I&# ;ve come a cross. I would definitely recommend!\n
 This is a very well made cat tree.  Easy to assemble.  The cat loves it!\n
