He had them off within one day and now just chases them around the house. We have had this for about 3 months . It is also very attractive everyone comments on it . It is in our living room . I have been thinking of buying the larger one too now that I have seen how sturdy it is and just how well made it is in general . Also no carpet debris on the floor like normal scratchers .

I am sure with most tall cat trees there will be some shakiness to them unless the base is heavier and has a lot more weight to it.

While it was expensive, it was a great deal compared to what I have seen available in pet stores over the years. She loves sleeping in an on it, scratching it, and playing on it. The hammocks on the sides are the things she does not use because she is a little too heavy. If you have normal-sized cats or kittens, they would enjoy every aspect of it, I think. When I purchase it, I hadn't seen any bad reviews. I made a few modifications to it when it arrived to better suit my cat, but that is not necessary for all cats.

Select an alloy drill with the same diameter as the expansion ring (pipe) of the expansion screw, install it on the electric drill, and then drill the wall. The depth of the hole should be the same as the length of the bolt, and then lower the expansion screw kit and the white anti tipping strap on the cat climbing frame into the hole. see less",

She bought new twine from a craft store, then use a hot glue gun to adhere it as she wound it around the post. Not sure how crafty you are, but you could get carpet samples & replace the carpeting either with glue or staples depending on the location. You can usually get carpet samples from home improvement stores (even for free depending on the size) like Home Depot, lowes or a mom & pop shop. If you\u2019re not very crafty or just don\u2019t want/have the time to do it, I\u2019d assume you could hire someone you know or online via an app like Next Door or your local town\u2019s/city\u2019s Facebook page to connect with ppl in your community. Or those task/odd job apps that work kind of like Uber/Lyft/InstaCart business but you pay ppl to do or help you with whatever (i.e. assembling IKEA furniture, painting a wall, hanging shelves, etc\u2026) sorry for the long response, as I don\u2019t want to make assumptions as to what you\u2019re able/unable or even want to do.

It can handle their weight and all; it won't fall apart. The only thing is that it can shake a bit. Though it may depend on the cat whether they are ok with it (as both of ours are). To be fair, most cat trees will shake a little with cats jumping up it. Most cat trees are not made of solid metal or bolted to the wall all along its height to prevent this. see less",

L-brackets were what I used, after a lot of regular houses were shaky despite good materials, I got for my indestructible mega house when I built it from scratch... They are very cheap and will securely hold a middle plank between the bottom (cut some carpet so it is always wood touching wood!) and middle-they attach to the 2x4/4x4 (mine has two 4x4s on the back from the floor to the roof and another from the base to the second level, the others 2x4 and the bottom having some extra staircase style beams to reinforce the second level without wasting space)... All have brackets, the roof ones the trickiest since I had to squeeze some smaller ones into v's... The big ones I got have a curved in middle to strengthen them; the top are literally just an L with holes in them...for your purpose any would help. If there is a wooden beam inside the cardboard you can access, it can be reinforced...if it is cardboard, honestly, I would rather rip those out and replace them-wrap the jute around a wood beam instead of risking a lethal accident. The force of a tiny cat can be immense; I had to scrap an all-wood one after a few years JUST because the 7lb feline was so powerful that it made the screws less and less secure-deck screws...

If you leave it loose the plastic caps on the ends of each tube that hold the nuts and bolts can break.

The screw that holds the top platform on, screws in from underneath the top platform (that the bed stretches over). So, you must reach into the top level cubby hole to the ceiling to do so. Once the screw is seated, you just turn the platform clock wise to tighten it up, but do not over tighten it. Is this what you have been trying to do? Also do you have the right tool to fit the head of the screw? If I remember correctly, I think it was provided with the product. It is a nice tower. Good luck.  G.B. see less",

Frankly, I was concerned that this was less durable than the carpet, but it would seem that it is more durable -- I'm not finding the loose bits of yarn that I commonly find collecting round the base of the other cat-trees I have. While all cat trees will suffer from the depredations caused by cat-use, this one seems to be quite durable. The \"rope\" covered posts are particularly durable and are a real plus compared to the carpet covered posts I have on the other trees.

I'm functionally blind and couldn't see the instructions, even with electronic magnifiers so I spread the parts out on a table. I used the finished picture and sussed out how to do it. I put pieces together before fastening them. I didn't need to undo anything, it does make some sense. The scratching pad was awkward but after a bit I was able to get the bolts to start. Took maybe an hour or so.......FYI, cats will never understand I can't see them no matter how many times I stumble over them. One is black, I can't see black......They like the condo at least........ see less",

It occasionally wobbles when they are racing on top of it. But it's never gone too far off the ground. The platforms are big enough for my long kitties. At first I was worried but they fit perfectly and are always on their cat tower. And the boxes are definitely big enough for both of them. I've only bought this cat tree after going online for a few days and doing research. And like you, looking at comments and this mAker has great quality. As long as you continue to keep it clean and vacuum the hair up so it's always clean, this will definitely last. We've hAd it going on three years and it still looks great.

(5'7\") which is the top tier platform. The bottom tier platform is on the floor and the top of the bottom house which is on the bottom tier platform is (1') high from the floor. The 2nd tier platform is (1'11\") from the floor which has the 2nd house on it and it's top is (2'9\") from the floor. The 3rd tier platform which is above the 2nd house is (3'4\") from the floor. The 4th tier platform is (4'1\") from the floor and the top tier platform as I said earlier is (5'7\") from the floor. I hope this helps you. My cats love the towers and use all the tier's. Just as a side note, I would recommend tightening the tower(s) at least once a month as with lots of use depending on the amount of cats you have the platforms will loosen. I'm very pleased with the towers I purchased and I'm sure your cats will love the towers. see less",
