                  "review": "\\n  I recommend this tree as a beginner tree for one or two small kittens, or a very calm and elderly cat. The package instructions say to stand it against a wall, which goes to show they know it\\'s not very sturdy. The pillars seem to be plastic poles but in actuality they are just hollowed out tubes made of some thick cardboard with round plastic ends that are inserted to the tubes to link with the screws given. The tubes snap easy, my top pier did within 24 hours. The bottom platform rocks. I emailed them about replacing the top piece and I did not get a reply back. My one-year-old cat who is very excitable football tackled the whole tree to the ground and she\\'s not very big.\\n"

She has a small adult cat and a very very large adult cat and they both were able to get on top at the same time. This was placed at the center of her room but hope to put it near a wall preferably near a corner where it can hug two walls just for safety and more stability. The quality of the product is ok but that is what we get for this good price. It is made from particle wood so it does seem fragile. For now it works and hope that it can last years. It makes the cats happy and therefor my mother in law as well. Thanks :-)\\n"
