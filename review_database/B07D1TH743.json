                  "review": "\\n  Just got this new cat tower- in the photo the new on I just put together is on the right. My old, well cat loved one on the left I got at Petsmart about 7 years ago and I included it in my photo for comparison. The new one was very easy to put together- I would be careful not to overtighten the screw together joints or you could risk popping out the metal connectors. Theres really no need to over tighten it anyway.<br/>The carpet appears to be similar to the carpet on my original tower. Some reviews I read prior to this purchase stated that their cats shredded the carpet- well guess what???? Thats what cats do and its better they shred on the tower than your precious couch&#128521;! Let me repeat that- cats love to shred on carpet! You can sprinkle a little catnip on this to help train them that this is their space to shred away! As you can see in the photo of my old one it is well shredded- you can take scissors and trim the frays from time to time if needed and the rope can be replaced as needed also. The lower perch on my old fell off last week- its fixable- just need some screws.<br/>Some reviews also stated their cat could not get up because if the configuration of the perches- then something is wrong with your cat! Cats are natural climbers and mine are like flying monkeys racing up and down the tower! My male is 18lbs and has never knocked the original over even when he is having major road rage- it will teeter a little but it always rights itself. Really stable and sturdy- this new tower appears to have the same building sensibility put into it.<br/>Just out if the box I am happy with this purchase  and would recommend it to a friend!  This new tower cost me about $40 less than my original one on sale at Petsmart for $180. So that was a plus!  I will update how it goes in the future if anything comes up.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  My cat stopped using his previous cat tower because the cardboard was weakening and he didn\\'t feel safe.<br/><br/>He\\'s a big cat (18 lbs)  and I know it tipped over on him once.  So, I spent a good deal of time searching for a good solid tower when I found this one.  I was sold on the \"solid wood\" and manufactured in the USA.<br/><br/>Once I put this together, I noticed it was shaky, not sturdy. The partially covered round perch gave way when my cat tried to use it, then he stopped again. It was loose, so I had to unscrew the other post with the highest perch first before I could fix it. I tried screwing the rounded covered perch all the way in but it was never tight enough until the opening part of the circular perch was facing the other post.  Certainly that won\\'t work, my cat wouldn\\'t even be able to get in &amp; out of it!<br/><br/>It was a horrible struggle, but we managed to put a thick cloth around the post that connects to the other sisal rope post.  That was the ONLY way to get it tight enough to be stable. After all that, now the whole tower wobbles from the very base. It seems the very bottom platform and connecting posts should have been configured smarter, differently, to offer more stability.<br/><br/>On one side especially, if my cat were to run and climb quickly to the top, it will tip over.  The base is way too short with less than desirable positions for the posts.  So now I have to see about anchoring it to the wall for the kind of \"sturdy\" you advertise.  So much for \"Made in America.\"\\n"

The posts are attached at an angle to the base, which is itself warped and unstable; the staples used are 3/8\" and meant for paper, NOT carpet, so they pop out and are dangerous to the cats; and the phone number for customer service is routed to nowhere, directing that all contact be through email, which never elicits a response.

The tube with the \"window\" is definitely awkwardly placed. They have to either crawl out the window to get to the top, which they rarely do, or scale the opposite side of the tube, which they do frequently. They don\\'t have quite enough footing on the tree for scaling the other side, so there is a lot of struggle and clawing their way to the top. My cats are young, so it\\'s not really problematic (and a little comical), but I could see it being a big issue for older kitties that want to be in that high perch. Even my young cats mainly use the scratching posts and the second level perch. It is pretty sturdy, as long as you have it on level ground and it  does look nice. Super, super easy to put together and all my peices fit. The top nest is nice and deep, which my cats also like, but I feel like they don\\'t use it much because it\\'s difficult to get to. With two cats trees, I\\'m happy with this, but would consider a cats abilities before purchasing.\\n"

It&#8217;s been 2 days now and he hasn&#8217;t been wary of it at all and surprisingly, did not freak out because something new was added. He immediately sat on top of the stuff to explore when I opened the box. He seemed more interested than put off by the smell and started rubbing on everything. It took me 5 minutes to assemble, but an hour to disassemble the top perch from the pole. I decided to take off the top bed but keep the pole because there wasn&#8217;t much space between the bed and the top of the tube for my cat to stand up or have the ability to jump up there. I kept the pole in case he wanted to scratch on it. I&#8217;m very happy with the size of the tube and the beds. The tube is big enough that he only has to crouch a little to stand, and he is easily able to turn around in it without having to stick his face out the window. I think the window of the tube is big enough that he could climb through it if he tried. The other perches can very easily hold him without him spilling out the sides like on his old tree. There is even extra room for him to spread out on the middle one. The only thing I&#8217;m disappointed by is how close together the middle perch and the tube are. The tube slightly hangs over where the middle one is which means there isn&#8217;t as much room for him to jump. It&#8217;s fine for getting inside the tube but I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;ll be able to jump straight up to get on top of the tube. I&#8217;m keeping his old cat tree next to the new one as a platform to jump off of for now but maybe he&#8217;ll get more comfortable in the future. Overall I really like it and he will already jump onto the top of the tube if he&#8217;s interested in a toy up there and I&#8217;ve found him napping on the middle and perch once already.\\n"

The base is not heavy enough for free standing.  It needs to be wedged under a piece of furniture, like a sofa, to keep it from falling over when cat jumps high.  I have ours up against the wall between the tv table and a bookcase.  With a heavier base shipping would cost more, so I am happy with my purchase :)\\n"

Not tons of little hiding spaces and toys dangling. I especially needed platforms large enough. So many cat trees cater to kittens. But what about when your cat is full grown and won&#8217;t fit in the houses, hammocks or on the multiple small platforms??  I highly recommend this tree. It was also extremely easy to assemble. You will probably need help getting the box in the house and out of the box.\\n"

It took about 10 minutes to assemble it and it seems quite sturdy I would definitely recommend this kind of cat tree using solid wood and real carpeting means that it should hold up for quite a long time.\\n"
