Unfortunately, the bottom piece  is not strong enough to hold back the two pieces with just the washer and it pulled the material in half. I was able to reinforce the bottom with some boards I had but for the price, I expect much better quality. The second picture depicts how the tower ends up when my cat jumps off.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  UPDATE: The company reached out to me, concerned that the product I received had broken so easily and was unsafe for my cats. They promptly sent a replacement that had some helpful design changes. The replacement cat tree is far more stable and no longer wobbles all over the place when my cats jump up on it. So far the little flower perches have held up this time and my cats are throughly pleased to have their bedroom cat napping spot restored.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this cat tree. My cats wanted to love this cat tree. You see, they were several months overdue for new Kitty trees and toys so I ordered them a flurry of goodies here on Amazon, including this cat tree.<br/><br/>We had high hopes. However due to the way this cat tree is constructed (the bottom piece folds in half, held together only by the carpet and a bolt inconveniently placed at the center of the two pieces) it wobbles and sways more than a drunk person at a frat party.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the smaller yellow flower ledge also snapped in half when one of my cats jumped up on it. His name is Fred, he is very conscious about his figure so imagine his dismay when he jumped up and the ledge holding him snapped in half. Needless to say it didn&#8217;t do much for his self esteem.<br/><br/>If I had time I would return this product. But alas, it&#8217;s the holiday season and I think I may be several days past the return window now. That said, be aware that this product is clearly not worth the asking price, I&#8217;ve seen better engineering from five year olds with legos.<br/><br/>Now, thanks to the failure of this cat tree to deliver a fun, sturdy perching/playing/napping option for my mini lions, my wife and our army of cats have convinced me that I must instead build new cat trees from scratch.\\n"

I will probably transfer the posts to a piece of wood but that&#8217;s not what I paid for the item to do. I wouldn&#8217;t by unless you have a slow lazy cat that just sits, ours are young and do the most so that probably why it broke.
