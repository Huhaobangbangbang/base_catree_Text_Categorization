                  "review": "\\n  &#160;This cat tower provides Our kitty with a lot of room to rest and play.  I really love the sage green color. It just looks more tree lake and is more fun than the traditional beige. The base is why enough to support the height of this tower.  All of the scratchpad areas are covered well. The material underneath is not exposed making it more difficult to shred.<br/><br/>It can easily be assembled by one person. However I will add that the base piece has three holes. These holes aren&#8217;t labeled, so make sure you put the right piece into each hole based on the look of the final product. I did not do that and had to disassemble and reassemble to correct my mistake. That being said, I was easily able to fix my problem. Everything else goes together very easily per the instructions.<br/><br/>My cat loves sitting in the very top bed. She loves perching a pie. This bed is wide enough for our adult cat. We have had a few cat towers that are better designed for kittens or smaller cats, this does provide adequate space for her. She has a lot of fun with the fluffy ball toys. She enjoys batting them around. But her favorite activity for this cat tower is enjoying a nice cat nap.<br/><br/>The top perch that she enjoys taking her naps in is easily washable. It has a removable cover that can just be taken off and put in the washing machine. All the other surfaces are easily cleaned with the vacuum.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  - 1st, it is smaller, I have a smaller space and another cat tree already so, it works well for me to not have multiple enormous cat trees in a small space. I measured before ordering and it fits into a smaller odd corner, with the hammock wrapping around the edge.  I moved it away a bit from the wall since the photos, so he had more access to both sides to lunge and grab hold of<br/>- It is really cute with some interesting things and my cat is at that tween kitten age that he needs to be entertained (hence the two cat trees)<br/>- At first, I was excited that the different platforms were labelled, but it would have been way more helpful to me to have the posts labelled and the screws separated and labelled  watched and paused the video to figure out.  It was frustrating at first, I had to take apart and reassemble a couple times.<br/>- My initial assembly issue was  I was using the two smaller green posts at the bottom, and actually it should be the two mid-size green posts at than the one of the smaller fuzzy posts on top (has the holes to put the sticks in on side that are not visible) the other smaller fuzzy post goes on top of the luau cave; the two sisal posts are stacked with the hammock; the pet bed on top of the cave and the smaller fuzzy post is cool, it just wraps around one of the square posts.  I opted to use the ramp going to the cave elsewhere, it gives him more space on the bottom, and he doesn\\'t need it to hop in<br/>- it feels sturdy<br/>- it\\'s cute and a nice mossy green Hawaii them that I like<br/>- the cove I was worried that he wouldn\\'t like, and I do like it -- he loves it too.  It seems too small for him to me, but he wouldn\\'t get out of it when I was trying to screw that part together to give you an idea.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>*Cute<br/>*Kitten Size (maybe I will combine with the larger and make a monster cat climbing gym, but having the two in different areas is working to run from one to other and peak attention it seems)<br/>*the cave has softer walls, which my kitten seems to like<br/>*cat seems to like the play toys and although seems a bit small to him, so far day one he is def attracted to it.<br/>*I did pay less for my larger cat tree, however this is complimentary, and I like the Hawaii Lua / Moss Green tree theme to this one\\n"

I added weight to the base and pushed it against a wall to avoid this happening again.<br/>If I were to reorder I\\'d definitely READ THE DIMENSIONS because it\\'s also quite a lot smaller than I imagined.
