                  "review": "\\n  First - the tower is well made and easy enough to put together.  I purchased it for a rescue cat we had just adopted.  I was excited to receive this tower because it wasn\\'t too tall/large ( for my office ) but had a large enough platform bed for her to sleep on, and a \"basket\" which on reviews of other towers seemed to be cat\\'s favorite part.  She\\'s not an overly large cat - 10 pounds, but the configuration of the top square platform ( not shown in my pictures we removed ) did not give her enough room to get to the hanging ball to play with or comfortably move from one level to the next, so we removed it.  After a month and a half of her not paying any attention to the basket, we also removed that and eventually added more sisal so she can have a taller location to scratch on.  She only uses the pole to scratch, not the ramp ( another feature I thought was great ); loved the hanging ball ( until she overstretched it too many times and snapped it off ); rarely goes in the house - but does.  Loves the platform bed and its large size ( many other towers I saw had smaller ones ) allows her to be cozy but comfortable . Every cat is different - so yours may love some of the features that mine did not.  I think the key takeaway is how large your cat is and will this be functional for them.  It was a good price so I didnt think making the adjustments detracted from the positives about it\\n"

I ended up taking the bed off which made it easier for him to sit on top of the box and jump to the platform. He will only go on it every now and then. Hopefully he\\'ll get use to it.<br/>I loved everything else about it.\\n"

It suits my small cat just fine, she\\'s a bit over seven and half pounds, but she has already pulled the mat up out of the scratch post entry thing. She isn\\'t that strong so that says a lot about the quality... It\\'s great for the price, I suppose, so I won\\'t complain.\\n"

Tower looked exactly like the online picture after assembled, was pleased....My cat went right to it after it was set up, and placed by my living room window.  She&#8217;s an adult, only 2, and not a big cat...on the smaller average size, and she seems to fit just fine on all the perches and in the house part.  She loves to look out the patio window on her new tower perches!  It&#8217;s so soft and mostly sturdy, just a teenie weenie bit wobbly, but not bad.  I like the ladder part so she can either climb or scratch on it.  I don&#8217;t know who likes it more, me or her lol, but all in all, it&#8217;s great and worth the money:)\\n"
