This post is rather tall, so cats will not be climbing it. If they try, they might topple the post. Our more curious cat was eager to sniff out this new post as soon as it was put in place (replacing one that the two cats have managed to shred). Sisal is a much better choice than corrugated cardboard, which can send tiny airborne particles into the noses of our feline friends. Yes, the sisal slowly shreds and sheds, but it\\'s easy to remove from the base with a simple brushing. I do wish that these manufacturers would use carpet fabric instead of the white, fake-fur material, which very quickly becomes dirty. Our previous post had a base of a mottled brown carpet fabric that never looked dirty (even though it probably was).\\n"

In that time he has gave that post a beating every single day and although a lot of the cord wrapping is pulled off- it has stood up to the his daily abuse in fine style. Max is a Norwegian Forest Cat. \"Wegies\" are climbers and they have extra strong claws that grow back extremely fast after a good trim. Max also has a six foot high cat tree as and he can use his front claws to pull himself up to the top, so I needed a good strong, ultra durable cat scratcher for him when we brought hi home.  There are several features that I love about this post.  First the base is wide and attached to the post very securely. As strong as Max is- and he is tall enough to reach about twenty inches up the post- I have never had this tip over. Heck, it has never even moved during the most furious scratching session.  Second, I like how it comes in two heights for extra large cats and average size ones. Also, it is built of really durable material that can take a beating and last for a very long time.  I HIGHLY recommend this post if you got a cat that loves to scratch. In the time I have had this post Max has never touched a piece of furniture with his nails. He  loves this thing as  much as I do!\\n"

From a human viewpoint, assembly is a no brainier using the included tool. Its the small additions that I appreciate, such as the large washer on the bottom that should stop any more rocking, plus the small rubber feet in each corner to keep it from sliding around. Its also not overly large or tall and fits perfectly in a corner.<br/><br/>The feline viewpoint is shown in the posted images. Its received the full nose check from our 6 cats and they seem to really enjoy the spring loaded puff ball, puff balls being a favorite in our house.<br/><br/>Final verdict:<br/>Human: 5 stars<br/>Cats: 5 stars<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this review and I hope its helpful\\n"

They are identical except for height.  The taller one can tip over (due to the somewhat small base), which hasn&#8217;t happened with this shorter one.  (Of course, the best would be a tall one with a larger, heavier base, since my cats love to stretch up when they scratch, but they have a cat tree for that.)  Decent but far from fancy.<br/><br/>But that&#8217;s JustMe.  (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)\\n"

After this batch, I\\'ll likely be adopting senior cats in need.<br/><br/>My cats are outdoors/indoors, so I needed an indoor scratch post to keep them away from drapes and furniture.  My adoptees took to this post right away, how grateful and blessed am I!<br/><br/>It was very easy to assemble, and what I especially liked is that I CAN ASSEMBLE IT WITH ONE POST (LOWER HEIGHT) for the kittens; THEN, AS THEY GROW, HEIGHTEN IT BY ATTACHING THE 2ND POST.  The 2 dangles and whack-a-puffball have been an absolute draw + deeelight to watch!<br/><br/>I cannot review its durability, but can edit my evaluations later if necessary.\\n"

Other scratchers at the same price are shorter so this is a steal. It&#8217;s tall and stable, comes with the dangling ball thing that will entertain them more. I spray some catnip and they immediately get to work lol they scratch it every day. It&#8217;s tall enough for them to stretch too. Im glad i found this after looking around. My sofa can live in peace now lol\\n"
