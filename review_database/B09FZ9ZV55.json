                  "review": "Assembly: It was not difficult to put this together. (about 45 minutes) It works excellent if you follow the assembly instructions to the letter. I only had two problems: 1. Because the pieces aren't labeled, you had to \"find\" the correct piece and hardware to use on it\u2014but there aren't many to get mixed up with, so it worked out fine. (There was one bolt that was shorter than the others, but it was in its own bag!). 2. The screws did not always \"catch\" as quickly as I had hoped. Screwing the covered box hole down to the base, for example, needed a little force to get it correctly. It was also difficult to line up holes to screw \"blindly.\" But none of this was due to a manufacturing defect; it was simply a case of \"lining it up.\" Simply take your time, note where the holes line up, and then get to work."

Because the pouch basket swivels (depending on how tightly the poles are locked around it), you can put it around the pole wherever you like! (Because my kitten is too little to jump from it to the nearest platform, she liked being able to walk down in the center.)"
