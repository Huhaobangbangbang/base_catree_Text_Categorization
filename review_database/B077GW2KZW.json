            " MULTI LEVEL ACTIVITY CENTER- The four level design of this PETMAKER Cat tree provides numerous levels of fun and allows your favorite feline to jump and explore the cat tower. Perfect for kittens or cats that love to climb, and for multiple cat use!  ",
            " COZY LOUNGING AREAS- Cats love nothing more than to snuggle up after exercising. Each tier contains plush and comfy areas for your furry friend to peacefully relax or nap. The cat condo is an ideal cove for hiding and sleeping, while the platforms and bed/perch area lets your cat fulfill their need of sitting at a higher level and allows them to look out over their surroundings.  ",
            " SCRATCH AND PLAY SPACE- The tiered cat tree has multiple scratching posts to give your cat a healthy outlet for their scratching needs, instead of using your furniture or carpet! The sisal rope scratchers on the cat tower are naturally durable and safe for your pet to use and the differing levels of the posts also help cats to stretch and tone muscle. Not only is this the perfect scratching platform, it is also ideal for playing to expend some of the energy of a younger kitten!  ",
            " PRODUCT DETAILS- Dimensions: 22.5\u201d (L) x 16.5\u201d (W) x 43\u201d(H). Color: Brown. Spot clean or hand vacuum. Particle board construction covered in 100% polyester plush fabric, sisal scratching post. Recommended for all cats and kittens 10 weeks or older  "

I looked at them, then tossed them aside dismissively, only to realize that the backwards-seeming instructions were actually correct. Ah well...  The cat avoided it for a few days, prolly because of the new thing in the house smell, but she loves it. I have it near a window so she can watch the birds and squirrels from it.<br/><br/>She completely ignores the top level, so I placed a large 10\" potted plant on that level. I have noticed when she vigorously plays with it, it wobbles a bit, but not in any danger of falling over. It does collect cat hair and when she scratches the posts, small bits of the rope collect over time, so I keep a garment lint thingamabobber to collect cat hair and rope bits every few days.  All in all, well worth the money spent.\\n"

He loves climbing it and playing with the attached ball on the string, which surprisingly is still attached after weeks of use.<br/><br/>The only \"complaints\" I have would be that it does seem to wobble a bit if he jumps on it too quickly when he has the zoomies (we do have it positioned between a wall and the end of a couch, so I\\'m not sure if it would have tumbled by now without that extra support), and the hole in the second-to-top level is in a bit of an odd spot. He likes to lay down and always ends up with a limb or two hanging through it. I wish it were more off to the side to give a bit more room for kitty lounging.<br/><br/>If you\\'re looking for something at a good price point that gets the job done, this is it! Attached a couple photos--don\\'t have a good photo of the whole thing because of how it is positioned.\\n"
