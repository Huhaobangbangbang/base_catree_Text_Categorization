THE THING OF IT IS THESE TYPES ARE MADE FOR LIGHT WEIGHT CATS AND THEY\\'RE MADE FOR SINGULAR OR VERY FEW CATS LIKE 2 CATS IN LIGHT WEIGHT VARIETY I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE WAY IT\\'S MADE. THE POLE THAT THE PADS SIT UPON WELL THE POLES SIT ON A PLASTIC CASTER AND IT BARELY GOES UP INSIDE THE POLE AND THIS IS NEEDED FOR SUPPORT . THE POLE MOVES WHEN THE CATS GET ONTO THE PAD WHICH SIT UPON THE POLES WHICH SIT UPON PLASTIC CASTERS WHICH ARE SITUATED LOW ON THE PLATFORM. THE CASTERS NEED TO GO UP INSIDE THE POLE FOR A PRETTY GOOD WAYS TO GET PROPER STABLE SUPPORT OUTTA IT FOR NOW THE POLE BARELY GETS FITTED ONTO THE CASTERS WHICH IN TURN OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU\\'LL SEE THE POLE START TO SWAY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND EVENTUALLY IT TOPPLES OVER AND YOU\\'LL SEE WHAT I\\'M SAYIN.. I\\'M NOT PUTTING DOWN THIS COMPANY OR THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE I\\'M NOT THEY\\'RE GOOD PEOPLE THERE\\'S JUST A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW.. IT\\'S EASY TO FIX AND THIS COMPANY IS AWESOME IN CUSTOMER SERVICE NO DOUBT THEY EVEN GET THE PARTS YOU NEED OUT TO YOU ASAP. ONCE I SEEN WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS I EVEN EMAILED THE COMPANY AGAIN POLITELY SUGGESTING HOW THE ISSUE CAN BE FIXED PERMANENTLY THERFORE INCREASING THEIR SALES THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND CUTTING THE REPLACEMENT OF PARTS OUT TO CUSTOMERS IN HALF ACTUALLY IT\\'D BE MORE THAN HALF AFTER THE FIX.. BUT I NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY BACK AND THIS IS AFTER THE REPLACEMENT PARTS FAILED. I HAD TO EMAIL THEM AGAIN THEY REPLIED SAYING THEY\\'LL GET NEW PARTS TO ME BUT I\\'VE NEVER SEEN THEM..I WISH PEOPLE COULD SEE THE HELPING HAND INSTEAD OF SEEING SOMETHING ELSE THAT\\'S NOT THERE..I\\'M AN HONEST PERSON WHO LIKES TO SEE PEOPLE PROSPER IN A POSITIVE MANNER AND THIS IS THE SAME ATTITUDE I CARRY TOWARDS COMPANY\\'S I REALLY LIKE BUYING FROM. IT\\'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD BEEN RAISED AROUND ENGINEER\\'S ALL MY LIFE AND WAS TAUGHT TO HELP YOUR FELLOW HUMANS I\\'M SORRY Y\\'ALL BUT I SEEN RIGHT AWAY HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE AND MY DAD &amp; GRANDAD WERE ENGINEER\\'S AND THEY SAID IF YOU SEE IT TELL IT SAVE SOMEONE SAVE A COMPANY.. ANY WAY GET A CAT TREE FROM THESE PEOPLE THEY\\'RE GOOD HONEST FOLK IF Y\\'ALL NEED ANY HELP LATER LEMME KNOW I\\'LL BE HERE ALWAYS..\\n"
