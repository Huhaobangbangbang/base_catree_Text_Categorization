                  "review": "\\n  This is the crowning piece to my cat wall. It is a bit tricky to install though, especially if you put it up as high as I did. You need to use a provided template to drill 4 holes for the attaching screws will screw into (easy part). The hard part is, after assembling the house, you need to attach it to the wall, lining up holes on the back of the house to the 4 holes you drilled earlier. The house is not light and you\\'ll probably need the help of an extra set of hands. It\\'s not clear from the instructions, but this is NOT TO BE INSTALLED IN DRYWALL. That said, I didn\\'t catch that and only found out after installing and reading more reviews on Amazon. I installed into one stud (coincidence), so it feels pretty solid. Sidenote, this was the last piece I added and I \"eyeballed\" the leveling after being so careful to level all the other pieces. You can\\'t tell from this picture, by my eyeballs were wrong! This house is a little crooked. I have a Catsuit Mario plushie I\\'m thinking of attaching as if he\\'s dangling off the edge, making the house tilt with his weight. Then I\\'ll tell people it\\'s crooked on purpose :P\\n"

Unlike other FUKUMARU products&#8230; this was a little more difficult to assemble and might have been a little easier with a second set of hands. Spend the extra money on good products like this, it won&#8217;t disappoint.\\n"

Absolutely do not attach it to drywall alone (or use the included anchors) we actually drilled 2 extra holes in line with a stud, so that we could have three sturdy screws directly in the stud. Then, we got the most heavy duty Molly toggle bolts they had at Home Depot for the holes that hit drywall. You don&#8217;t want this tearing out if the wall and falling to the floor with your kitty inside!<br/><br/>Our cats stated exploring right away, and they love their cat wall!\\n"
