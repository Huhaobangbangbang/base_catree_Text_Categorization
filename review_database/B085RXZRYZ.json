With a picture of the product from my phone and the instructions included it took me maybe 45 minutes. It is pretty sturdy but some of the fur does come off during install. I just used a lint roller and rolled the whole thing. I took a little catnip I had and rubbed it all over. My cats seem to enjoy it and I have 3 total. 2 adult cats and a new kitten and it holds all of them. The white strap is to attach it to a wall which a screw and anchor is included.\\n"

We used to have a taller one but my husband didn\\'t want as much of an eye sore this time, so I went with this one that was medium sized. It will work well and was the best priced for it\\'s features and ease of assembly. The only real difference between this and the taller ones is maybe one of the attachments on top standing a little taller. My fatty cat (pictured) checked it out immediately and played with the hanging ball, went to scratching the post, and crawled inside the little box with his fat self. He stepped onto the hammock but didn\\'t stay in it. He may be questioning it holding his weight or just not interested at the moment. Truth be told, my adult cats will use it,  but it\\'s perfect for kittens because of the short height between each level, making it easy for them to climb hide and play.\\n"

I can see it flipping over with more weight in the little hammock or from the force of a bigger cat jumping off the top.<br/>Building it is sort of difficult. The instructions are pictures, which is fine, but getting the pieces lined up/screwed together takes some patience. Probably took about an hour and the little cubby/house piece could not be mounted as described because the holes were improperly drilled. I just mounted it with the doors to the front and outside, instead of front and facing into the rest of the tree. Took about an hour to put together.\\n"

The unit itself is not bad; it is not quite as big as I thought it would be; I can\\'t see anyone buying this if they have a larger cat.  Mine is perhaps 8 lbs at the most; she has shown no interest in this at all, after having if for a few days.  i even sprayed it with a catnip infused spray but that has not enticed her to this.  Now as far as the instructions - forget it!  They are basically useless.  Pull up the pictures on Amazon so that you can see how to put it together.  I am still hoping my kitty will someday take an interest in this; then I will consider the item a better rating.\\n"

It&#8217;s really cute, I love the color which is a smoky grey or something like that. Now the negatives, I&#8217;m missing the hanging bed on the side. Also as I was unboxing it, the pieces weren&#8217;t the same, exactly as the product shown. Which as you can see it&#8217;s slightly different. I&#8217;m not mad that it&#8217;s a little different, but I do wish it would have came w/ that bed, so that was disappointing. Also the instructions were terrible. It took me over an hour to figure this out, or maybe it was just me. But there was little to no info on the instructions. Other than that, it&#8217;s a cute cat tree. But I do wish I had the product shown, w/ the hanging cat bed, w/ better instructions.\\n"

Now I have to go to ACE and spend more money!<br/><br/>EDIT: I do not recommend this product for a rambunctious 5 month old kitten. It is not very stable, even up against the wall. Our kitty has this rocking like crazy when he gets his zoomies. Hasn\\'t knocked it over yet but pretty sure he will eventually.<br/><br/>Final edit: screws are coming lose, my kitten has knocked it over more times than I can count! NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE EFFORT!!@\\n"

Have to put weights on the bottom of mine so when my cat jumps up on it, it doesn&#8217;t fall over on him. Which as happened multiple times. The top purch is very wobbly and it will never be sturdy how much I tighten the bolts. Not worth what they have it priced at. Only reason I give it two stars is bc it does look like the pic.\\n"
