The basket is sized for a kitten. It is not sturdy. My cat was trying to get up it and it almost toppled over. The base is in 2 pieces which I feel is why it isn&#8217;t sturdy. I am most likely going to return it and find a larger one.\\n"

The only thing I don&#8217;t like is the bottom not connecting (the two pieces only connect via one screw on the top bed). It&#8217;s a great size for big cats though! That was my main worry - but both my fatties will fit just fine!!\\n"

I use the enclosed bed to play with my owner who is fool enough to stick her hand into my space! Then the two toys are enjoyable in my spare time. My human wants me to use the scratching posts but I prefer  to hear her yell \"stop that\" when I sharpen my claws on the new couch.<br/>Owner review: The tree was easy to put together but did take a bit of time. It is very sturdy, strong base and low height.\\n"
