I only took one star off for the sharp corners on the cubby portion and it didn\\'t include a stabilizing strap. I noticed the corners before I ordered so I also got corner protectors and problem solved!<br/>It\\'s sturdy and roomy enough for my 16 lb. Maine Coon and I like that it has one section of scratch post tall enough for him to fully stretch and scratch. The top perch is the largest and he lays on it with legs dangling but that is what he prefers anyway.<br/>My petite lady loves the cubby but even the big guy gets in there. This is where I keep their toys too.<br/>Happy Camper Cats!!!\\n"

Hardly wiggles at all when he jumps up there and he&#8217;s 15 lbs.  The cat box thing is actually big enough for him to go in, and he does.  The other ones on standard cat trees were pointless because he couldn&#8217;t fit. This is awesome because you can wash the pillow parts, they don&#8217;t come off too easily so the cat doesn&#8217;t slide around, and therefore doesn&#8217;t hold any stench like standard cat trees.  Glad I tried this!\\n"
