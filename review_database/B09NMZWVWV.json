When I purchased my leather sofa, I invested heavily in various items for them to scratch on.  THIS was their fav!  It only lasts about 3 months but for 3 cats, but I am pleased.  Very easy to assemble!  Both times the box was delivered with large tears/openings.  They need to package the product in more sturdy shipping boxes.  I WILL purchase again!!!\\n"

I put some heavy duty double sided tape over the 3 bottom bolt heads. The bolt heads are not countersunk. Did not want to scratch my tile and needed to keep it from moving. My 20 pound cat can get crazy wild.<br/>His little sister of 12 pounds doesn&#8217;t really need the step but she likes using and laying on it. She does use the carpet post to scratch on. Both play with the balls when laying on top. I am very happy with the purchase. Serves my purpose using it as a step. It is also the perfect height for a step and looks nice. I purchased the grey.\\n"

If you are just looking for a small scratching post for your cats it is fine, as long as you get all of the parts to assemble it, but I would not rely on the toys lasting too long, they seem to be poorly made and loosely attached.  If not for the missing part and shoddy toy quality it would be a solid 4-5 star piece.\\n"
