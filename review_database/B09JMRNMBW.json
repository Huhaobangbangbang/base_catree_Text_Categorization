I have 2 kitties both 3 years old the tabby is 12 lbs and the orange and white is 16lbs.<br/><br/>I bought this to replace a tattered old tree whose scratching post had destroyed.  I was specifically looking for something sleek/modern looking with a \"high\" bed and a scratching post. Based on the reviews I figured my orange cat would be unable to use the tree given his size but figured he\\'d enjoy the scratching post and I could use the bottom box to store their toys. Well much to my surprise both of my kitties are all over this tree. I\\'ve only had it assembled for 24 hours and have already captured so many cute photos of both of them using it. I did spray it with their cat nip spray so they knew this was theirs. I\\'m very happy with my purchase.<br/><br/>I definitely think I\\'ll be buying a second one. I\\'m very impressed with this cat tree.\\n"

It also weighs very little, which means that my 7 lb. siamese cat can easily pull it over when she\\'s trying to use the sisal post.  The soft areas attach to the smooth surfaces with quarter-sized velcro stickers, and while they do hold decently well, I don\\'t see them holding long term.  I wouldn\\'t recommend this tree for anything but a kitten. Even then, it\\'s too expensive for what you get.<br/><br/>Update - The tree is now selling for less than 70% of what I paid, so I\\'d consider it a good deal for a kitten. Other than that, look for something bigger.\\n"

He curls up well both inside the box and up top on the bed. He\\'s a curling up sort of cat, not a sprawling out cat. If he were a sprawling cat, this might be a bit small for him (though he does like draping himself over the edge of the top portion). The height is perfect for seeing out of our windows too (not obnoxiously tall, just medium height and simple). As far as quality goes, I\\'m happy with this cat condo too. I wanted something that wasn\\'t covered in bad carpet and that looked nice in the house. The laminated wood looks pretty nice on this, and it\\'s sturdy and was easy to put together. I also like that all of the pads/beds are velcro, so you can take them off to wash them.\\n"

The pads do not stay stuck with Velcro pads provided. We could not figure a way to make the top most pad stay fastened at all. We bought this for a specific spot. I am going to try using some old tree parts and adding a plywood top above the box. Then We will see elastic straps to some old cat beds we have already. If it works I will review again with pictures. I am going to recycle some bolts from old cat trees as well. If we end up using this, it will barely resemble what it started out as. If you are buying this tree for full grown cats, don&#8217;t. It might be good for kittens. But leave the top shelf completely off. It is dangerous. I will put a couple of 5 pound dumbbells in the base  to stabilize.<br/><br/>I modified it using old cat tree parts. I stabilized the base so it doesn&#8217;t fall over when a cat jumps off. I added a larger platform to the middle as well as an old cat bed that has elastic in the 4 corners so it doesn&#8217;t slide off. I used a top platform from an old cat tree that has side for the top platform. The cat tree is stable and each perch will hold a full sized cat now. My oldest cat expresses her opinion of both the tree as well a my modifications there in the picture. I am keeping it remind myself to consider any cat purchase at least 16 times before I buy.\\n"

The platform below is not quite big enough for the cat to use to lay on, or even use as a step to get to the top platform. It certainly looks great and perhaps would be better for smaller cats around 9lbs. Or if there is something else they can use to access the top platform. We use the bottom cuddle area to hold toys because it&#8217;s a bit small for our cat and went unused.\\n"

It looks exactly like the photos.<br/><br/>This one has a faux wood veneer that actually looks very convincing. It\\'s super sturdy. I assembled it in less than a half an hour, very simple.<br/><br/>It is compact in size, which is great if you don\\'t want something huge in your living space. I have a 10 week old kitten and a 12 lb. adult cat. The box and top perch are large enough for my cat. The middle perch is the right size for my kitten. My kitten took to the scratching post right away.<br/><br/>I really appreciated the little details on this, like the Velcro stickies for the mats/bed and the 3M rubber tabs that ensure it doesn\\'t scratch my floor.<br/><br/>The only things that could be improved is making the top perch a smidge larger and a few small aesthetic changes, but I would definitely buy it again.\\n"

The insert for the box is very cozy and thick. The liners for the top of the box and the top of the tree are actually much nicer than what I would have anticipated -- pretty cushy.  The unit comes with Velcro stickers to affix the pads and covers for the bottom box\\'s screws so they don\\'t mess up the floor.  Both of my cats love the tree (and so do I)!
