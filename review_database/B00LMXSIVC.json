                  "review": "\\n  please think carefully about your cats and do not buy this product. I put all of the negative reviews aside and bought myself this cat tower with high expectations that it would be perfect for my two flame-points, but unfortunately for me, it was far from that.<br/><br/>when I first purchased this cat tower and it arrived at my front door, I was more excited than I\\'ve been in the longest time. I was glad I had finally gotten something I thought my cats would enjoy as there seemed to be a lot of things to do and play with, and I love spoiling them.<br/><br/>when I brought the two boxes inside of my house, I opened them and started assembling the cat tower by laying the scratching posts and objects in front of me so I could build it properly.<br/><br/>I first noticed how many nails there were stapled horribly into one of the cat houses, and this one was the cat house that lies on the top along with the stairs.<br/>this cat house was also cracked on both front ends of the cardboard; pieces were coming off as I carefully placed it onto the floor. I had figured that happened due to rough shipping, but then I noticed another cat house that belonged on the bottom of the cat stand. this house had numerous nails poking upward so that your poor little felines paws would get punctured when they take cover in the house, or when they play. these nails weren\\'t just in the front of the house, they were also inside placed vertically.<br/><br/>I have never in my life seen such a dangerous cat stand.. Go Pet Club should\\'ve used screws to assembly this cat tower, NOT nails that were clearly misplaced or just tackily put in without thinking of what it would do to the feline.<br/><br/>I got cut in numerous places on my fingers trying to get these objects out of the box, and I\\'m worried because I haven\\'t gotten a tetanus shot. I could only imagine what a days worth of playing on this thing would\\'ve done to my cats. besides, I ordered what was supposed to be a NEW cat stand, not one that was refunded as there was another cats fur on this.<br/><br/>I hope you\\'ll make a wise decision and get something better for your cat(s) rather than this accident waiting to happen.. you\\'ll also be saving your money. thankfully for me, amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  Our old cat tree was on the way out, and I really didn\\'t want to get one with the bells and whistles that the cats either destroy (hanging toys) or ignore completely (ramps, toys on springs) so when I saw this, I was optimistic. Platforms and scratchers, that\\'s all I needed.<br/><br/>I love how compact it is, while still being tall enough for the cats to survey the land. We have 2 cats: one is a ~8lb short hair, the other is a Maine Coon that\\'s 20lb of love and fluff, but he can move the fluff around for sure. He has no trouble jumping up top and taking a nap, and even fits on the 2nd from top platform. There\\'s a little wobble just because, you know, 20lbs, but nothing where I\\'d be concerned about the overall stability of it.<br/><br/>The smaller cat is more interested in the hideaway on the bottom and the scratching posts.<br/><br/>I didn\\'t put the leaves on since it felt like they\\'d be destroyed in an instant. Overall this is such a good value and exactly what I needed.<br/><br/>I hope you found this review helpful in deciding whether or not to purchase this.

                  "review_title": "WARNING: DANGEROUS FOR BIG CATS!",
                  "review": "\\n  I hope this review will serve as a warning to anybody with large cats who is considering buying this product. I bought this new cat tree for my 2 adult male cats. It is a lovely cat tree, especially with the earthy colors and the decorative foliage. But it is way too small, and dangerously so.<br/><br/>My cats are 12lb and 14lb, so it\\'s not like they are grossly overweight (in fact, the 12lb one is very thin). Even my smaller cat can\\'t fit comfortably into the baskets, and when he does, the entire top 2 sisal segments bend over like the leaning tower of pisa (there is nothing to stabilize it at the top). The main problem is that the sisal posts are too thin and cannot support a lot of lateral weight from the basket (my other cat trees have much thicker, sturdier sisal posts). It looked unstable so I tried to keep my cats out of the top basket, but I can\\'t supervise them 24/7. When my 14lb cat tried to nap in the top basket, the entire top portion with the 2-segment sisal post completely snapped off! I\\'m going to upload a picture if I can. The parts were screwed on tightly as they should be, but the plastic center of the sisal post completely ripped out from the screw due to the weight of my cat. The manufacturer should have included some kind of a weight limit warning! I\\'m pretty upset because my cat could have been seriously injured when the tree suddenly snapped and he pummeled down unsuspectingly, and I want to warn anybody who has large cats.<br/><br/>If I could unscrew the whole thing and fit it all neatly back into the shipping box, I would return it. But that would probably be impossible. So I use it for my foster kittens now, in a separate room. They love it, and it\\'s perfect for them (they are about 1-3 lb). However, it\\'s still a broken cat tree that I paid over $300 for, and I only had it for 2 weeks. I contacted the manufacturer Go Pet Club for a replacement part so that I could mount the top piece again (for the little kittens), but they said since I bought it through amazon that I would have to contact them. Amazon said they could ship me an entire replacement, but could not replace just the one broken part. The manufacturer was polite, but basically said if I wanted a replacement part I had to purchase one from them...well I already spent $300 buying a poor quality cat tree, my cat almost got injured from the product, so I feel like they could have at least sent me one replacement part free of charge. The entire experience has left me disappointed and exasperated.<br/><br/>It\\'s such a shame because I think this would be an awesome cat tree if they could somehow increase the size of all the parts. I would recommend this cat tree only if your cat is under 8lbs or so. I\\'m not really sure how the previous reviewer\\'s 3 large cats can use the tree without breaking it, but perhaps they just don\\'t climb into the baskets. The 2 round cat perches are also too small for my cats to lay comfortably. There are probably only 2 places that a large cat could comfortably lounge on (the very top cubby and the bottom area). It is just not an appropriate cat tree for large cats.<br/><br/>On another note, my cats also chew on the fake leaves, and I\\'ve had to clean up green cat vomit a few times until I finally removed the leaves. The tree doesn\\'t look nearly as good without the leaves though. Also, the frame for one of the hammocks wouldn\\'t screw together right so that the parts ended up not being completely flush with each other (they probably weren\\'t cut right on my set).<br/><br/>Aesthetically, I\\'d give this tree 4.5 stars. Quality - 3 stars. Endangering my cat - 0 stars. Minus a couple of stars for not replacing the broken sisal part.<br/><br/>Please put a weight limit on this cat tree!\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  I purchased this item on 8/25/17 and it arrived in a timely manner. Set-up was simple. My cat enjoyed it for several months, spending her days relaxing on the different tiers. However, this all changed one horrifying evening. At first, it appeared as if our cat was simply playing near the top of the cat condo. Suddenly, she began violently kicking her back legs and scratching. This caught our attention and we watched with partial amusement, thinking that she was only playing.  After about 10 seconds of frantic kicking, our cat began making a horrific noise. We then knew something was very wrong. We ran over the to cat condo to discover that our cat was actually choking and that her frantic kicking with her back legs was temporarily preventing her from \"hanging\" herself. It turned out, while weaving in and out of the \"monkey bars\" near the top of the cat tree, my cat\\'s neck became entangled in the loops of rope securing one of corners of the hammock. The rope was wound so tightly around her neck that I was having difficulty inserting scissors between her neck and the rope. As a physician, I can surmise that our cat had no more than a few seconds before asphyxiating. Luckily, I was able to free out cat and she lived to play another day. However, if this event had happened at night or while we were at work, I am certain we would have walked into our living room to find our cat dead. To those of you that have already purchased this item, throw it out OR remove the hammock.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  I just got it and I can\\'t comment on the longevity of the item, but first impressions are hard to beat.<br/><br/>First, the carpet on here is so soft - I wasn\\'t expecting that. I was expecting the standard scratchy stuff. It feels more like fake fur material (not really fluffy or thick), but it does the job nicely and feels good to the human touch.<br/><br/>Second, it only took about 20 min to put together.<br/><br/>Third, the stability is much better than I thought. I looked at several cat tree\\'s varying in price from under $100 to over $300. This one seemed mid-range so I was expecting mid-range quality. Not at all. It is sturdy and strong. The basket was my biggest concern since my 12 lb cat loves the hammock style thing. It is made of metal inside, so I don\\'t have to worry about it breaking like I would have if it was just a thin piece of wood.<br/><br/>Fourth, the look is just beautiful! I hadn\\'t expected the leaves to come with (thought that was just dressing for the website pics), but they did. The overall look of this with and without the leaves is so wonderful that it looks just fine in my living room. I don\\'t have to worry about it standing out as an eye-sore or feel like I have to explain to visitors that, yeah, that\\'s the cat tree. It makes it\\'s own statement.<br/><br/>Fifth, the design is wonderful! I\\'ve seen many other cat trees, but this one seemed to have several different styles for the landings. Many have the flat landings and a \"house\". I\\'ve seen several with the hammock type thing. But this was the first I saw with the half-barrel hide out. This has so many different elements, every cat is sure to find something it likes. Each of mine have at least two spots I\\'ve seen them enjoy.<br/><br/>Last, the size is very nice. I\\'m sure you can see the measurements and get an idea, but it is such a nice size I thought it worth mentioning. It is not small, by any means, but it is also not overpowering.<br/><br/>Well, that\\'s my take on it so far. My kitties are enjoying it immensely. I love seeing them and it in my living room instead of hidden away in the bedroom.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  STELLAR CUSTOMER SERVICE: First, Amazon\\'s customer service pulled through with flying colors when we had problems with shipping due to a couple mishaps by both Amazon and UPS. Our prime shipping turned into an 8 day arrival time even though our tree was only 30 miles from our front doorstep by day two at a UPS warehouse, and no one thought to first give us the chance to at least come pick it up ourselves on day three. It was a birthday gift to be given at the same time as two new kittens in a wonderful and surprising way, and that was ruined. We ordered it six days prior to when we absolutely had to have it to set it up for the gifting, even though it was marked \"Prime Shipping,\" just to be safe and ensure we got it in time. We didn\\'t, and it spoiled the kind of experience and surprise we wanted to create. However, Amazon always makes things right and in an extremely fair way, because they place the customer first and take responsibility. So we are 5-star pleased on that front with no hard feelings because of it.<br/><br/>CONSTRUCTION and MATERIALS: Second, if you\\'re considering this particular tower, it\\'s worth it. We saw in person several other brands and styles. All were way overpriced for the size and quality, some 1/3 the size of this without any thing but one shelf to sit on and a scratching post, but still $70! Others as large as this one were flimsy, cheaply made, and wobbled, or had no other creative activity spaces but one. This tree has many, and it is very sturdy. Any tree you buy at this height is going to have the potential to wobble or sway if you try and make it do that, like if you lean your full weight up against it or push it, or if two large cats jump on it and scramble up it at the same time. But the tree sways only a small bit when cats do that, and never to the extent that it may topple over. You can\\'t avoid that at all with this height in respect to its base width. You would have to double the base size and use all solid 2x4s or 4x4 wooden posts. It will look more bulky, take up more space, and that kind of quality and construction is going to cost a lot if it still comes with all the various play levels, two houses, perch, and a feeding platform like this one does. For the pillars/scratching post base, this tree uses what many others use, rolled hollow cardboard tubes rather than top-heavy wooden posts that might topple over at this height, and wrapped in quality and highly durable sisal. However, many others use tubes of a smaller diameter making the weight from the height put too much pressure on them and they can break or bend. While this tree uses 3\" diameter posts, and not the 4-5\" kind other models boast, it uses a lot more cardboard material for its tubes to create a thick and tightly rolled post that is incredibly sturdy and unbendable - short of driving a car over it, so don\\'t let the diameter worry you with this particular tree. Not all 3\" posts share that quality.<br/><br/>ASSEMBLING and HOUSES: Putting it together delivered a solid tree without anything loose, wobbly, or cattywampus. We laid out all the scratching posts according to their designated letter in order to make sure we didn\\'t mix them up. We kept a lot of space between them so like E wouldn\\'t roll over to F without our noticing. We laid out the hardware in the same way too. The instructions were easy to follow because my 16 year old son read them and directed me as to what to do. It went together easily. My husband gave every level\\'s screw or post a last tightening without overdoing it of course. You don\\'t want to strip anything and give reason to future instability. The houses are very different than many other trees too. Others between $80 and $130 price range had the material stretched over a frame, so the walls of the houses were just like a tent. Or, they were made out of very weak and cheap cardboard or flimsy particle board that quickly looked uneven and sloppy. (Display models at your local pet stores can corroborate this, testifying to how little use it takes to make some trees unsturdy or unappealing, as well as how little \"extras\" and platforms/houses they have on their trees for their price in comparison to this one.) This tower uses a 3/8\" thick particle board for the house walls and 5/8\" for the ceilings, and they are also very sturdily constructed, compacted well. Sure, if you put enough bendable pressure on the walls in ways it wasn\\'t built for it is going to crack. How do I know this? I was trying to staple gun a hanging mouse over one of the door openings, and while the particle board is heavy duty enough to NOT allow a staple gun to penetrate the staple through its material flush, and only 1/3 of the staple went into it, when I hammered it as hard as was needed to sink it into the particle board, the board bent in with a crease about 2\" and got a 3/4\" crack. Most people know to not hammer particle board LOL ... doh!  So, unless you perform WWE wrestling moves on it, the houses will remain sturdy for years to come. No cat will be able to bend or crack it. The best part is the size. The largest cat can fit through the openings and they are extremely spacious inside. The top one could fit two full grown cats curled up, and the bottom could easily fit 3 or 4. They are fun. None of this kitten-sized-only stuff for only $40 less.<br/><br/>WATER/FOOD BOWL: Another favorite feature that makes this tower unique is the feeding dish on the middle platform. It is marketed as a water bowl. Uhhh, no. Not in my family room it isn\\'t. I don\\'t think that is wise at all, not so much because of the room it is in or the flooring it is on, but because of the cat tower itself. Water around any kind of particle board no matter how solidly crafted is never a good idea and softens and weakens it over time, if not immediately. Additionally, the wet material covering it might dry quickly all the way through, but it might not. Repeated exposure will create smell, mildew, etc. So we use it to feed them their dry food. They eat there every single day. No batting at water and getting the carpet and platform wet and soggy over time weakening its sturdiness. Just dry food. It\\'s wonderful. Then in our kitchen there is a spot where we feed them their wet food. Their dry food bowl is always empty by the end of the night, and it\\'s a rather large bowl too!<br/><br/>IVY LEAVES: Sure the kitties like to bat at the green ivy leaves, and the leaves are much cheaper than the quality you\\'d buy at a craft store, comparable to a dollar store frankly. However, they are of the perfect shade of green that makes the ivory tower look lovely and elegant, not too dark and not too light. Too dark can create a messy or harsh look, and too light creates a cheap look. To be safe, we used a staple gun and stapled the ends of the vines into the platform \"wood\" (about 5/8\" thick platforms,) and hammered them flush to the board below the carpet for safety, being careful with the hammering force, (but the platforms can handle a lot more than the house walls.) A 1/2\\' staple worked best. Occasionally one of our little stinkers accidentally pulls a leaf off when using one of the scratching posts, but it\\'s still not noticeable. The leaf can\\'t be put back on unless you glue them with an immediate drying craft glue. I don\\'t think you need to worry about the cats chewing the ivy. Ours don\\'t, only bite at them once or twice now and then, but don\\'t chew. They have grown accustomed to them just being a part of the tree, albeit sometimes in the way of their scratching. Eventually I\\'ll exchange it out with a better quality ivy from Michael\\'s that has the leaves attached by sliding the stem over another little stem sticking out of the the garland. Then they can just be placed back on when they come off. In the meantime, it is not a deal breaker or a reason to not use the ivy. The beauty of this tower is its ability to look classy in the most upscaled room possible, (better than ours,) because of the effect the contrasting green ivy leaves have with the ivory scratching posts.<br/><br/>SIZE: Don\\'t fear that something so tall might look imposing or obnoxious in your home. Of course every home and room size offers different options for different sizes. If this were shorter, it might seem too bulky/wide, but at this height it looks more slender and narrow. Since I have included pictures of ours in our room and how we use it, it will be helpful for you to know that the room is 20\\' long and 16\\' wide. The wall in the photo that has the cat tree on the left of the fireplace and the artificial tree on the right side is 16\\' across if that helps. Our ceilings are 9 feet. I\\'ll admit that if you have standard 8 ft ceilings, it might be a bit intrusive to your space depending on the layout and size of your room, but with a large window nearby or good lighting and such, it can work. We previously had a second tall artificial plant in the spot we put the cat tree in, and this replaced it tastefully and quite easily to keep the balance on both sides of the fireplace. It is the best cat tree on the market today because a room can maintain its elegance while providing a playground for cats.<br/><br/>ACCESS TO EACH LEVEL: Our cats had no problem learning to climb to each level, and the top pedestal is their favorite spot.  Every level has an area that allows jumping to the next level unlike many other cat trees who have one or more levels directly above the lower one with nothing to jump from, and only the most determined and crafty cats will use the scratching posts to climb their way to the next level. Such a silly oversight if you ask me. Our cats use every single platform equally and energetically, chasing each other up and down the entire tower continuously to our amusement. They immediately made this their home, errrr Palace!, and their play yard. They get so much use out of it every single day, keeping them plenty busy and entertained, and we just know that wouldn\\'t be true for most other towers. Some reviewers on this site or others might say they wish that the two outer platforms to get to the top house stuck out a bit further to give more space from which their cat can jump, but still love it regardless. I would have to agree, and about 1\" more would do it nicely, however it might make the tower look too out of proportion, since it presently is perfectly proportioned. Some cats like ours have no problem. Since they learned it as kittens, they will have no problem as an adult. When compared to so many other towers, I don\\'t see many large cats having any problem at all getting used to this, getting to each level and to the top, unless of course you own Garfield.<br/><br/>NOTE: Our photos - We have more toys hanging and attached than come with it. The mouse at the very top and the two ropes are what come with the tree and are sturdily attached, with the ropes using a very smart attachment style which is screwed into the upper base. But we added various other toys on other levels for more fun, so if you see any of those don\\'t expect them to come with the tower.\\n"

Can fit in a corner but goes very high which cats live anyway!  ( 86\" high )<br/><br/>I absolutely love this cat tree however it has taken my cat a few days to get used to it because he\\'s not the type that gets overly excited. He\\'s the type that kind of just stares at something and sniffs it.  He\\'s curious and wants to know what everything is but he doesn\\'t necessarily jump all over everything.<br/><br/>For a few days, I had to actually put him up top to show him that\\'s what he\\'s supposed to do.  He loved the hanging cat toys but remained uninterested in the tree. I started to get nervous that I would be wasting my money until I realized I needed to move the tree. originally had the tree in a corner so I moved the tree in front of the window.  Now, he loves it!  He can look out the window and watch the birds. He sometimes sleeps in the bottom house but enjoys the top platform more.  He doesn\\'t fit in the smaller house on top so I actually took it off.  Now he can have a larger platform to lounge on.  It is not vital to put the small house on top if your cat won\\'t use it.  You can even remove the top perch so your cat can just have a flat top.<br/><br/>That tree is gorgeous but my only recommendation would be to make the steps wider and longer so that the cats don\\'t struggle too much to get down because my cat is a bigger cat and he almost slipped off the top in the beginning when he tried to put his paw down onto one of the sides. He\\'s not a huge cat but I think the two side steps that are right below the top should be a little bit wider and longer for a more ease in motion.  Other than this, it\\'s great!  He has gotten used to it more n more and no lo get has trouble getting down.  It would have been better if the two side steps were wider however, cats are very versatile and can figure things out!  If your cat/cats are small, I would say put the house on top with the perch but if they are bigger, it might be better to keep the top flat!\\n"

When you are notified that the unit will be delivered I suggest you obtain a generous supply of your favorite adult beverage. You\\'re gonna need it.<br/>2. You will also need a measuring tape, a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers.<br/>3. When the package arrives, actually there are two of them, clear out a LARGE space to assemble it very near its final location. This sucker is HEAVY and not easily moveable.<br/>4. I suggest you open the boxes outside and carry the parts to your assembly spot. The boxes are heavy!<br/>5. Sort the parts by size and the bolts / screws by bag number.<br/>6. The assembly directions are picture only. NOTE THAT THE DARK BROWN PARTS ARE RRPRESENTED BY SLIGHTLY SHADED ICONS AND NOTE THAT SOME HAVE HOLES THAT YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE PROPERLY OR YOU ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF CORRECTIVE DISASSEMBLY!<br/>7. Have a drink!<br/>8. When you assemble the bottom locate the proper position of the pieces by using the center piece as a template for the holes. In fact, the best way to locate the flat pieces as you go is to use the position of their holes relative to the front and rear.<br/>9. Have another drink.<br/>10. When assembling the bottom it helps to balance it on the long side and have someone steady it while you insert the bolts as shown. Then let it down quickly so that they don\\'t fall out OR tape them to the bottom to keep them in place.<br/>11. Have another drink.<br/>12. Now start screwing in the poles as shown. You will have a letter and a length listed on the assembly picture instructions. BE VERY CAREFUL TO MEASURE THEM AS YOU GO! Be sure that they correspond to the appropriate length on the last page of the directions or you will have crooked platforms and have to disassemble your mistakes.<br/>13. Apply adult beverages as necessary during the rest of your task.<br/>14. The hammocks are the trickiest part. There are poles with studs in their sides and with holes through them that have to be located properly. Be sure you screw those poles in with all of the studs and holes at the same level and at the proper levels or . . . .<br/>Yeah, more corrective disassembly will be required. Don\\'t forget to install the spacers between the upper and lower hammock poles!<br/>15. The last thing I assembled was the ladder. What to my wondering eyes did appear but that there was no bracket to attach it to! This was solved by drilling some holes in the appropriate platform and using some half by one and a quarter bolts, nuts and washers.<br/>16. The whole thing took about three hours and six Edmund Fitzgeralds to complete. The cats love it!\\n"

The one condo is very large and would absolutely fit a very large cat.  I originally bought a \\'huge\\' cat condo that ended up being so small that it could not fit my cats im the hammock or the condo. I had to return it and purchased  this instead.  It took me about 20 minutes to put together, it was pretty easy.  It is an awesome  cat tree for the price and the perfect size for adult cats.  A large or overweight cat would not fit in the Hammock, however, they would absolutely fit in the condo  and every other part of the tree. I built it  yesterday and all three have been on it nonstop. Enjoy this cat tree, it\\'s great! The fake leaves that come with it fall off somewhat  easily while they are playing, but I really really like them a lot so I added a stuffed monkey for a real jungle feel.  You can also buy more fake Garland leaves at the store for every holiday so it can be a Christmas or Halloween or fall tree with the leaves if you want to get festive with it. It is a great buy and I love it!\\n"

The rest of the tree is like new! I&#8217;m very impressed how well it held up and you&#8217;d never guess it&#8217;s well over two years old.

I wish they didnt use those stupid alan wrench type screws or at least include a tool that is magnetic or easier to keep hold of. The top bed wobbles even though everything is screwed in tightly its just bc it doesnt have anything preventing it from swaying since its just on a post. My cat doesnt go in the the \"hidey holes\" so those are a waste for us. But all in all its what I expected that way. But what I did expect and didnt get was there are no directions on HOW to attach the fake plants to the structure. You cant just wrap it and expect it to stay and look nice. I had to un screw the top base from the 2 front supports a bit and shove the ivy so it was pinched between the 2 and re screw it together to hold it on which was a PITA. Then wind it around then do the same at the bottom but this time the screws were on the bottom bigger PITA! Could easily be solved by putting loops on the ends of the ivy and including it in the instructions with those steps the screws are used in.\\n"

So, here\\'s the deal:<br/><br/>a) It\\'s not Amazon Prime and slow boated to you from China.  You and your little boys and girls will be bored to tears waiting for it to be shipped to you.  Well, when it gets there, just be prepared to deal with the fact that it\\'s almost 85 lbs of particle boards, low-pile carpeting and sisal wrapped particle board tubes. The quality seems decent, nothing seems flimsy, which is good.<br/><br/>b) The instructions (printed on one letter sized sheet and not exactly laser printer quality) are not entirely idiot-proof, as the individual pieces are not marked and keyed against being built the wrong way.  The instructions will assume that you have a tape measure handy and can figure out, say, the C columns from the A columns.  You would have to take all the components out of the box and mark them.  In mine, the platform on the very top of the tree (where the mouse on the bungie cord lay) did come with the sides not well nailed together, and I have to do some minor carpentry to nail/glue it back into place.<br/><br/>c) The assembly process isn\\'t too strenuous given that you have the standard IKEA rechargeable electric screwdriver set with the allen key bit, and that you sort out and marked all the components beforehand, or else it\\'ll be you digging through the parts trying to figure things out.  Securing the top apartment on the platform below is a headache - it\\'s fastened from the bottom without any guiding pegs to pre-locate the one screw that locks it in place.<br/><br/>d) If you are assembling it with your furry boy or girl in the room, you\\'ll notice that they will be extremely interested in helping.  My girls can\\'t keep their paws off the tree during the assembly process.<br/><br/>e) Once complete, don\\'t even bother putting the plastic vines up.  Your cats will chew on them, and it\\'s not exactly healthy - I am not sure what Chinese plastics are made from, but it\\'s certainly not rainbows and sunshine.<br/><br/>Overall, a good bit of kit.  It will get wobbly if you do not prop it up against, say, a corner, and if you have more than one cat, they will fight for a spot on that top platform.  The bottom apartment is next to useless as the cats will never go inside.  The food bowl on the middle platform will be used like a gong by your cat(s) as they take turns knocking it down - so do yourself a favor, do not put water within, unless you enjoy cleaning up spills.\\n"

At first I thought it was going to be TOO high, but after about a week, my cat now lives up there most days (especially since putting it directly by our window for him to see out of;<br/><br/>2) It is incredibly sturdy! It took some time to put it together (about 20 to 30 minutes) and I was surprised at how hefty it was after coming together. I really appreciated this, considering how tall it is, as I was afraid of it might be unstable. My cat is about 12 pounds for reference, and he fits comfortably on each level, with no issues jumping up/down.<br/><br/>3) The connecting arms between each level are also scratching posts and my cat loves kneading these.<br/><br/>4) Not that my cat cares about this part, but I really like the neutral colors, and how it isn\\'t a complete eyesore. I ended up not using the green faux leaves that come with it, as it looked kind of cheesy, and we have plenty of real plants in the room.<br/><br/>Overall, highly recommend this if you\\'re also searching for a cat tower you don\\'t hate looking at every day, ha!\\n"

My biggest complaint is it is so incredibly hard to put together because the pieces are not labeled and the directions do not tell you which side faces up or down. For such a quality product, you\\'d think they could help the consumer out a bit more with directions. I had to disassemble pieces about 5 times total because something wasn\\'t put on correctly. The directions are so poor I\\'m going to give it 3 stars. This thing took me 3.5 hour to put together. It should have taken 45 minutes but you have to measure everything to know if it\\'s the right piece. If I\\'m spending this much on a disassembled cat tree, the directions need to be much clearer.<br/><br/>I ordered the F2097\\n"

It\\'s pretty straightforward, with a table that gives an approximate measurement in inches of each part needed, and the pieces fit together well. Just takes a little extra time to ensure you\\'re using the right post. Arranging them by length at the beginning of this undertaking also helped a lot.<br/><br/>2. For those with messy pets like mine, you might want to elevate this tower off the ground a little. All the platforms, including the base, are made from particleboard that looks like it would puff up and start to rapidly disintegrate if it ever got wet. Even with the water bowls across the room, I could see my cats or derpy dog contriving a way to make this happen. X) I might paint a spare pallet and slide it under the tower just for a little extra peace of mind.<br/><br/>3. This isn\\'t strictly necessary, but a staple gun made decorating with the vines MUCH easier, and now I feel like they\\'ll actually have a chance of staying attached with a wily feline yanking on them.<br/><br/>Mitch the Ditch Kitten (now a spoiled house cat) was very eager to check this thing out and went right into the house as soon as I unboxed it. His favorite feature seems to be he embedded food bowl. I\\'m definitely going to add some more vines and dangling toys to this tower as we go.

The first thing I want to mention is that the little mouse-on-the-string toy lasted WAY longer than I expected.  Our two cats (10 lb 1 year old, and 14 lb 4 year old) take any toy as a personal challenge to cause destruction.  The string held up for about a month, and even after it snapped, they continued to play with the little mouse (who was only slightly worse for wear with an ear off).  But, as for the tower itself, not particularly difficult to assemble, just took some time.  Husband spent maybe 2 hours on it.  The box was more than enough entertainment for the cats while he worked.<br/><br/>The construction is sturdy in that the pieces don\\'t wobble after connecting them.  We had to place our tower on carpeting, so there is a bit of wobbling when the cats are both jumping around on the tower, but after a couple of times they stopped caring about that.  It\\'s absolutely not going to tip over, so they just ignore it.  We did put some extra weight on the bottom just to be safe, but on a hard floor I don\\'t think it would even be an issue.<br/><br/>The thing does collect fur, and the soft fabric covering sheds a bit with use, but it\\'s been 2 months with daily use and there are no real signs of wear that concern me.  It just needs to be vacuumed off every week or so.<br/><br/>Bottom line: our cats love it.  For playing and napping.  I think the base piece should be heavier for safety reasons, and I think there should be a way to replace the string-mouse, but I\\'m still happy with the purchase.\\n"

Nothing comes labeled and it only comes with pictured instructions which is very confusing. In addition, I realized that a few of the pieces arrived broken so that was disappointing. Me and my boyfriend were in the middle of putting it together and two of the poles got completely stripped by the nuts inside. There was no other way of fixing it except to buy brackets and nail the poles on, so that\\'s what I did. I finally finished putting the tree together and it looks great but seems very unstable...I have a total of 5 cats which is why I decided to get such a large cat tree. However, the two pouch-like beds are VERY SMALL and my cats do not fit inside them at all. This is upsetting because on the old tree I had, the pouches were their favorite. All in all, I like the tree. It has great colors and is very big, which is what I wanted. I just wish it was more stable and made for larger cats. I hope it doesn\\'t break while my cats are on it! Just be careful if you are thinking of buying this cat tree and you have large cats because it is not the best! Lastly, I think it is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for the quality. Having pieces arrive broken is unacceptable when you pay so much for something. Hope this review helps!!!\\n"

All an all the tree is awesome and unlike others my cat who is roughly 18-20 Lbs has made it tot he top and not broken the tree. So it should do well with other husky cats. Yes I can attest that the house on the very top is meant for small cats although my husky cat was able to fit through the opening and come out through the other side without getting stuck. I would have given this 5 out 5 but the tree condo wood material are subpar. It uses some cheap type of particle wood that breaks easily. My condo arrived damaged in two corners. Although you cant see them as they are on the back of the first house on the bottom. So I was able to live with it. I would have used MDF its a littler stronger and would give it the much needed support for heavier cats. All in all its a good tree and my cats are loving it. I would suggest for peace of mind to attached a link between the far top left bed and brace it to the top house with some ort of link/rope/or something so it doesn\\'t wobble as much. Again this is more if you want peace of mind. its not needed but could give you relieve in case you have a heavy kitty who is a daredevil :)\\n"

Beerus is a heavy boy, who still tears around the house like a 2lb kitten, except with an extra 12lbs. He will rocket launch himself up on this tree, fly up it in a dust cloud, and leap off from the middle platforms. I am honestly incredibly surprised it hasn\\'t snapped. It\\'s super tall which was amazing for his escape from my dog, he could stand on his back legs and reach 5ft up (German sheperd grey hounds, amirite?)<br/>the water bowl is a great addition, if your dog isn\\'t capable of flipping it with his head. I ended up having to take it out (so the cat could smack the dog through the hole.)<br/>Point is, this thing is heckin\\' durable. You might need to tighten the posts often, but its not hard. Assembly has become second nature because apparently I can\\'t stop moving.<br/>The easiest way to clean it is with a pet vacuum. Does wonders.\\n"

I had to hammer my own hole to get the screw through.<br/><br/>Between the poorly written instruction and lack of labels, this thing took way to long to assemble, but the finished product seems sturdy enough.

                  "review": "\\n  I bought this cat tree almost a year ago, and despite some of the negative reviews, it arrived in perfect condition, the vines were present and perfect, I had no problems assembling it by myself, and I found the instructions easy to follow. It is heavy, so make sure you assemble it in the spot you want it. I do agree that the scratching posts should have been made to be on the bottom, and my cats do not use them, as there is not enough space on that level for them to be able to use the scratching posts, but they have plenty of other posts on one of their other cat trees that they have shredded, so not a big deal to me. I also attached a variety of cat toys all over this tree to make it even more interesting, and had a lot of fun doing so. I do suggest that you attach the \"hanging bridge\" to the lowest rungs, and not the second ones up. You can see the difference between the product picture and my pictures. Your cat will not be able to use the bridge for lounging if you attach it to the higher rungs. Hanging from the lower rungs, the edges of the bridge will be flush with the ledges on either side, and also provide more support for the cat\\'s weight.<br/><br/>I have 2 cats. A large female weighing over 13 pounds, and a small male weighing 8 pounds. This cat tree was a great addition to my cats\\' in-house playground, as you can see in the pictures, and has remained sturdy. Both of my cats enjoy this tree, but they each have chosen their favorite over time. My black male spends the most time on this tree and has not lost interest over the almost 1 year I\\'ve had it. My tabby female prefers the leopard print tree, which you can also see in one of my pictures.\\n"

I finally saw it for the best price and now it&#8217;s mine (and my cats&#8217; :)!<br/><br/>I&#8217;ve put a lot of cat trees together and found this one to be no more challenging than the others. It&#8217;s big! So it took me a bit longer to put together than my last 78&#8221; cat tree. None of the cat trees I&#8217;ve put together ever had anything but the photo diagrams and measurements but that&#8217;s all I needed along with a chair to stand on and measuring tape! It&#8217;s great if you have help, but I&#8216;m female, 5&#8217; 3&#8221; 130lbs and put this baby together all by myself so you can do this! The base and the hammocks were probably the most challenging parts but I got it done. The tree came in two boxes with no parts missing..everything was in good condition. I used a spare metal washer I had for the highest basket for extra stability and walla! I really like the amount of sisal rope for the cats to scratch on. And it just looks good! I enjoy the colors and the material is very soft. I discarded the faux greenery.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s very big, heavy and sturdy. I have 3 adult cats (all between 11 and 13lbs) and this tree serves all of them well. You can see all of them chilling on it in my photos. My main girl cat loves the baskets. And while these baskets seemed to be pretty shallow, she amazingly &amp; comfortably fits in them at 11lbs as you can see. She loves them!<br/><br/>I&#8217;m very pleased with this tree all the way around. Highly recommended.\\n"

I don\\'t usually write reviews unless it is really really bad and I have to warn people. First off, the ease of assembly and structure quality is not bad. Besides a couple of posts that could not be tightened, everything else seemed to be fine. However, my 3-month old kitten climbed to the top and tried to come down, he had tremendous trouble with it. It is due to the poor design of the circular beige step platforms being right underneath the brown polygon platforms that do not allow enough landing space for the cat to come down.  My kitten went down twice but fell both times because he actually needed to dump down literally vertically and his butt went off the platforms has he jumped and caused him falling twice. After that, he was scared to come down every time he got up there. I was going to return this but the only way to return this for free is to physically drop it off at Amazon Hub which is 20 miles away from me. Otherwise, it will cost me nearly $30 to return this via UPS or USPS. It is ridiculous. So I ended up keeping it but had my husband modify the design by cutting off a third of the brown polygon platforms to allow enough landing space on the beige platforms for my cat to jump down. Please see the photos of the modifications we did. Also, the included vine is also hazardous to cats.  My kitten was able to chew it apart in no time and the leaves broke apart from vines very easily. I don\\'t want my kitten to swallow any of it so I took the vine down and threw it away. In summary, I do not recommend this item at all. If it was easy and free for me to return, I would. This is not a safe structure for cats to climb unless you plan to do the modification as we did.\\n"

I looked online at different stores and at different types on Amazon, along with also looking in Pet stores in bigger cities. Anything I found of this size was hundreds of dollars more than this one. I was nervous, but if I was going to save that much money if this one worked out, then it was worth a shot. I am so lucky I took a chance because my cat loves this tree. It is very big and he especially likes to climb to the top and sleep up there during the day. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because of the hammock. It was a bit small and in an awkward spot. My cat never used it so after a few weeks I just ended up taking it off and my cat prefers it like that because it gives him more room to climb on it. Overall, without the hammock, this would have been perfect. The hole on the front is rarely used, but sometimes my cat will squeeze in there and hide just for fun, but it doesn\\'t get too much use overall. However, he loves the ropes and scratching posts. I tied some toys on it so they dangle and he plays with those as well. He even loved the leaves, which I thought were cheesy at first, but I\\'m glad I put them on. I would really recommend buying this for your fur babies if you don\\'t want to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars. This was one of the cheapest options I found that appeared to be a quality product and I was right. It\\'s extremely sturdy and I haven\\'t had any issues with it.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  If Chinese puzzles frustrate you then don\\'t buy this cat tree, but if you are handy and are willing to make a few modifications your cat(s) will love you. A tape measure will speed assembly up tremendously. The instructions were converted from centimeters to inches so 24.8&#8221; means about 24-3/4&#8221;, etc.. The pieces are not marked. It took about two hours from opening the box to completions. Our cat helped from start to finish. The top house has some shipping damage. The floor had pulled away and the nails were exposed and one leg of the house was cracked. My wife and her cat refused to let me put it back in the box. My wife contacted the manufacture and after providing photo evidence of the damage and purchase verification they said they would send a replacement part for free. Not wanting to wait for the new part to arrive I solved the problem by removing the floor and removing the exposed nails. I noticed the top house fit better without the floor so I didn\\'t reinstall it. With the screw no longer needed for the floor I drilled a hole in the top platform and used the floor screw to secure it to the top scratching post. I nailed the back side that hung down to the top platform. I think this is how it was designed in the first place and the floor was added for shipping strength. I used the floor to create another platform on the left hand scratching post. The bottom house fastening screws were protruding threw the floor so I removed them and put in a couple short screws. The top of the tree was a little wobbly so I placed four screws threw the bottom house into the poles at each corner, one screw per post, much more stable now. The left tower seems a little shaky and I will add a brace in the future.<br/><br/>***We received the replacement part about a week later.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  + Looks better than any cat tree thing I\\'ve ever seen<br/>+ Super soft<br/>+ Really easy to put together<br/>+ My cat loves it!<br/><br/>- Appears to be made mostly of thick cardboard<br/>- FLIMSY, like REALLY flimsy everywhere above 50 inches (it is 72)<br/>- Mine came damaged<br/>- It shed a noticeable amount while putting it together but hasn\\'t much since<br/><br/>Overall, I think I would buy this product again...you know, in 5 years which is what I would think the average cat tower should last.  If it doesn\\'t last that long I wouldn\\'t touch this brand again.  I need more time with it before I\\'d safely and seriously recommend it.  However, so far it seems like a solid purchase in comparison to other cat activity towers/trees.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I bought this mostly based on a height to price ratio with the looks sealing the deal.  It\\'s a great price for the ratio.  I expected it to be a touch thin or something to make that price happen, though I wasn\\'t expecting it to be THIS thin and flimsy.<br/><br/>It is mostly made of CARDBOARD.  Not pressboard and not particle board.  It\\'s just thick cardboard.  If I hadn\\'t received mine damaged to the point that I could see the material in a shredded state, I don\\'t think I would have known.  It\\'s sub-Ikea grade stuff, like the back piece on furniture such as bookshelves, TV/DVD cabinets, etc.  The fur-like covering on almost 90% of the contraption was shedding off in bits and clumps all throughout putting it together.  There are still no visible bald spots (a week in) though there is a bit of fuzz appearing randomly on the floor...it could just be loose, extra material from production.<br/><br/>When my cat is on the topmost perch and the level directly below it, the tree shakes violently.  The entire thing is a bit wobbly (perhaps the bottom piece is uneven?) but it seems to be acceptable to her aside from the very top.  We\\'re renting so we\\'re still brainstorming on how to neatly and discreetly anchor it to the wall because it absolutely needs it.<br/><br/>Basically, if I had a really fat cat or 2+ cats that liked to roughhouse, I wouldn\\'t trust this tree at all.  A fat cat would likely snap the sleepy bowl bed at the least.  Without stabilization, 2+ cats would probably topple it within a day.  When my cat did a full leap from it (after being scared from the wobbling), the tree smacked back into the wall...and she\\'s like 4 months old and pretty thin...so yeah.<br/><br/>Putting it together was really easy.  It\\'s only like a 5 step thing.  The instruction paper labels the parts but the only parts actually labeled are the screws which are in labeled bags.  That\\'s really appreciated.  Fortunately, the paper has a color gradient so the \\'fur\\' poles are darker than the scratch post poles.  Out of all the things I\\'ve ever had to put together, I\\'d say this one wins.  Considering I still have a stupid evil workout system in my garage that is trying to strangle me with it\\'s stupid pully system I can\\'t figure out...yeah, I really enjoyed putting this cat tower together.  Haha.<br/><br/>At Pet Supermarket, I had seen these $200, 4 foot cat \\'trees\\' covered in trashy apartment carpet so I was really looking forward to the \\'furry\\' feel of this one. It is so super soft!  It has a beautiful sheen, too.  The colors are deep and rich.  It looks like a really high-end product and not like a roll of dirty carpet as I\\'ve found everywhere else.<br/><br/>I think with a few modifications we can do at home (probably under 10 bucks) we can get this tree stable and keep it going for a few years.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  It\\'s very large, as sturdy as other models of this quality, and once you get past the baseboard, it\\'s easy to assemble. It took me about 2 hours just to assemble the baseboard because the images are confusing. They picture both the top side and the under side layouts. The illustrations of all the large platforms with holes are also confusing. Take the instructions advice, as well as other reviewers, and label all the pieces prior to assembly. Even then, I still confused two platforms but I figured the mistake out prior to going any further. If I can figure it out, anyone can.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that there are four screws intended to keep the hammocks secure to the posts and they are not long enough, they do not fit properly. However, this is easy to hack. I\\'m not savvy with tools and don\\'t have funky supplies laying around so I used BIC pens in the meantime. It seems to be stable enough. My obese cat walked across one of the hammocks and the pens didn\\'t crack. My average sized male cat (12 lbs.) slept in one of the hammocks more than once and he was fine.<br/><br/>I will comment in regards to one reviewer who said her large cat fell off the top basket because the post broke. It is true, this post (and the basket beneath it) is not connected to anything, making it very unstable for hefty cats. It is unfortunate this was not designed more safely. Make no mistake, it IS a safety concern. However, if you\\'re handy with hacks you could easily attach it by tethering it to a screw in the wall. Even so, if a hefty cat attempts to lay in any of the baskets, I have a feeling the baskets would eventually crack off, regardless of how secure they are to anything.<br/><br/>The condo at the base of the tree is HUGE. There is adequate space on top of it and to the left of it, for beds or smaller pieces of cat furniture, which is good for space saving in smaller apartments like mine.<br/><br/>Despite the design flaws (all cat trees have them because they\\'re probably designed by people without cats), this is a good investment for a household with 1 cat or a household with 1+ cats.<br/><br/>* When this product was first delivered to me, there was only one box. I called UPS and they referred me to Amazon. Amazon sent me a replacement tree free of charge (all I had to do was send the first delivered box back through UPS otherwise they would have charged me for two trees). I\\'m not the only one who had problems with this item\\'s delivery. Best of luck to everyone who orders this cat tree in the future.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  Very nice and attractive cat tree!<br/>Note, you have to assemble it, but it\\'s very easy. Took me about 20 minutes and only requires a little allen wrench (which is supplied).<br/><br/>Things to note:<br/>All of the padded surfaces are not covered with carpet, they are covered with a thinner, much softer fur-like material that feels very luxurious, but it not as strong or padded as carpet. Hopefully your kitties will scratch the rope-covered posts and not the surfaces... they wouldn\\'t last along against your panther\\'s claws.<br/><br/>Unlike our previous tree, note that none of these surfaces have lips or guards. Some sleepy or otherwise uncoordinated felines could potentially rolls right off while sleeping or playing. Being that ours is set up on the landing at the top of the stairs, with a 15 foot drop to the living room below. This could potentially be disastrous, but hey, they\\'ve all had a good run. Survival of the fittest I say. :) (Coincidentally, in all these years, I\\'ve never seen any of our cats fall off a cat tree (at least not that they\\'ve admitted to), but as I was assembling this new one, our smallest cat was watching intently from the top of the old tree, and in her curiosity of watching me assemble it, she rolled over and fell off the old tree backwards and dangled there until I rescued her. I hope this new tree does not induce such clumsiness.)<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the decorative garland does not have any \\'official\\' way to attach. It\\'s basically just 4 strings of leaves and you\\'ll have to figure out how to fasten them on - thumbtacks I presume. And of course, like any kid on Christmas day, the cats find the box and the garland even more interesting than the toy... but they do like it.<br/><br/>So, assuming all three cats live through the initial adjustment period, I will happily give this tree a high recommendation. And if they don\\'t, I\\'ll give it an even higher one.<br/><br/>Enjoy!\\n"

Still-- we are all enjoying it.  I do miss the old-school cat tree carpeting though-- cats love to dig their claws into that (and it helped as a grip if they started to slip).  This plush material is not the same (and isn\\'t cushy like carpet either).  They must not care much though, because they are on and in it daily.<br/><br/>For the build, sort the pole lengths and mark them with a light-colored Sharpie (I used masking tape labels on the platform backs as well.)  My son and I were building together and without taking the time to sort and mark we could have been in even more chaos!  As it was, we each thought the other one had bolted down the top house and it ended up falling off when the kitty started to climb up it!  (Fortunately, kitty is fine)  BUT, learn from us!

It\\'s VERY tall, covered in sisal all over and only took about 35 minutes to assemble.  The only criticism I have for this product is that -maybe- it would be a little better if the base were rectangular and not oval (though I\\'ve had no problem with stability yet, and doubt I will) and the little mouse hanging from the topmost platform has been torn off (though that probably has more to do with my kittens than the actual product).  At any rate, elastic is inexpensive and readily available.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I settled on this particular model because (even though it cost some $20 more) I realized that I would be living with this particular piece of furniture for the next 15 years.  Remember, cat trees aren\\'t just about what the cat needs - it\\'s a long term commitment that will remind you that you were a little cheap and got something that clashed (or you didn\\'t - good for you!).\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  Originally bought this as a 2013 Christmas present for my \"kids\": A 3-month old male kitten and an 11 year-old female who was trying to acclimate to the new addition to the family. They both loved this climbing tree and went crazy climbing all over it, racing up the sisal rope poles, jumping in the \"hammocks\", hiding in the house at the top or bottom, ripping at the fake ivy and sometimes going inside the lower house (mostly the older female to hide from the male; their both jet black.)<br/><br/>Assembly was pretty easy, although they are a few flaws I would recommend fixing in future versions. Some of the holes in the bottom were misaligned, which caused us to install the lower house backward. The cats didn\\'t mind, but it means that the instructions were a little weird to follow since the sisal rope poles were in front instead of the back. In order to avoid having the upper house come out backward, too, we had to improvise a little by mirroring the instructions for the opposite side. No biggy--we got it done.<br/><br/>The pieces that connect the front poles to the back poles serve as supports for the hammocks. You would expect them to be bolted or screwed into the opposite side due to the holes in the pieces, but there are no bolts long enough to use for this purpose. We have lots of hardware, so we improvised, but it seems that longer bolts should have been included for this purpose.<br/><br/>The ivy doesn\\'t really attach to anything--it just wraps around the poles. It looks cute, but the cats obviously rip it out every time they tug on it. I wedged it into the gaps between poles for a while, but finally ripped the ivy off after 3-4 weeks.<br/><br/>The mouse is attached to the highest platform with a string; that was torn off within two weeks.<br/><br/>The highest pole is my younger cat\\'s favorite, but when he got past 10 pounds, it started to wobble dangerously and required daily adjustments. Just when we had decided that we should brace it with something, the connector inside broken and the cat came flying off the pole. Fortunately, he landed on his feet, like a cat is supposed to.<br/><br/>Rather than fixing the broken insert, we decided to shorten the pole, so the upper platform is now positioned where the \"basket\" below the mouse is shown in the picture. My cats still love it and climb all over it, but I\\'m sad that my boy\\'s favorite high climbing post is now shorter and not as challenging to scale (he loved that ...). Still, it\\'s holding up 10 months later despite heavy use by two very active cats that both weigh more than 14 pounds. The female doesn\\'t appear to enjoy scratching the sisal rope poles, but the younger male goes to town on them. There are plenty of things for even the finickiest cat to enjoy. The plush material has held up much better than I thought it would, given how much my cats love to shred things, but I think that\\'s because they prefer rope and/or corrugated cardboard and have lots of toys and options for scratching. If they didn\\'t have any other options, I\\'m not so sure that the plush material would have held up--it looks nice, but certainly wouldn\\'t hold up as well as carpet. It is very easy to clean, though, if you have cats who produce hairballs ...<br/><br/>From the cats\\' enjoyment standpoint, this tower deserves 5 stars. Based on the design flaws and manufacturing and/or packaging mistakes, I felt that it shouldn\\'t receive more than 3 stars since it is quite expensive and should have had key elements last longer than they did.\\n"

The brown/black color combination with the pale sisal rope posts is very attractive. As far as stability...like a rock. It is sturdy, easy to put together and great looking.

The other issue is the particle board they use under the carpet is thin and cheap the left bottom leg of the ladder arrived broken so we will just glue it, if I was using this for a cat I would be concerned that glue would not work and the weight of a full grown cat could be a concern but for my little ferrets it will be fine. I have caught them all snuggling up in the bottom house and they love the hammocks!!! As for ferret use we did have to purchase some clear tubes so they could get to the top and secured them, overall I love it because it unique and adorable.......for the price I would have excepted better quality material\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  After spending a lot of time looking at different cat trees and reading reviews I settled on this one by Go Pet Club. I didn\\'t want to spend over $100, but I wanted something that was quality. This one had the most consistent reviews out of all the trees I looked at. At first look, the narrow design looked like it might be unstable and since I have carpet floors, this was a concern. I purchased this tree because it had everything I was looking for in a tree for a decent price. Two houses, two ropes, plenty of platforms, sisel all the way up the posts, and even a food bowl. The product arrived early which was a plus and the box was not damaged. The instructions were easy to read, but the pieces were not labeled. I used a tape measure to figure out which post was which so it wasn\\'t a big deal. Assembly was quick and easy, maybe took me a half hour to put together. From the time I opened the box, my cat was all over this thing. The little mouse was being harassed as soon as I took it out of the box. This tree turned out to be extremely stable on my carpet floor and I\\'m not worried about it falling over or have to weight it down. The little mouse on the top lasted maybe 10 minutes at the most before my cat ripped it off. I tired it back on by the tail and he ripped the body off in a matter of minutes. Not a big deal though because I didn\\'t expect it to last long. All the platforms are made of wood instead of cardboard so it will be easy to staple toys to it. Everything is covered in a very plush material that feels very soft and comfortable. There was a slight smell, but that\\'s to be expected from something that was manufactured and then thrown in a box to sit for god knows how long before someone buys it. All in all I would recommend this tree over the others. You cannot get something like this for the price at any pet store like Petco or Petsmart. My cat usually sleeps with me at night, but now he sleeps in the upper house. He loves it and I\\'m sure he\\'ll get plenty of years out of it.\\n"

This has the ropes, swing and a spinning scratch post at the base. I&#8217;m willing to bet you can add more toys of your choice to it easily. My one critique of this cat tree is it&#8217;s sturdiness. For my cat it&#8217;s perfect as I just have a 4 month old kitten. But, I would imagine if you have a larger sized cat maybe 15lb+ or just multiple larger sized high energy cats using this at the same time I&#8217;d be a bit concerned. I think if they made the base piece thicker it may provide better stability in that situation.<br/><br/>Another note is I took down the fake vines not even 15 minutes after putting it together as my cat was completely shredding them up and it&#8217;s a hazard as it&#8217;s mainly plastic.\\n"

My younger cat (1.5 yrs, ~10lbs) loves curling up at the very top, or running around like a mad women attacking the attached mouse and ropes (in the middle of the night, naturally). My older cat (8 years, also ~10lbs) checked it out but wasn&#8217;t too interested. It does shake a bit when Lily&#8217;s climbing around but it doesn&#8217;t bother her and doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s going to tip. I might secure it to the wall just in case. I didn&#8217;t put the leaves on because they were both trying to eat them straight out of the box. One downside&#8212;the screws stick out on the bottom, so you would need to put something under it to prevent it from scratching hard floors.\\n"

The bolt on the bottom should be recessed to it does not scape on the floor and cause the tree to very slightly rock. I put a rubber mat under it to keep it from scratching my hardwood floors.  Of course the greenery doesn\\'t stay on once the cats start playing and without it, it seems a little bare.  The other thing would be to make the shelve more padded with an edge around the top so cats can feel more secure. It would be easier to climb if the shelves were alternated a little farther out making it easier to get to the top but saying that, it is nice to have it compact enough to fit nicely in a corner.  I really love the tree but it just needs some tweeking.\\n"

The fake greenery lasted quite a few months, but I had to throw it all away recently as they were ripping the vines to pieces!

It took me a total of 3 hours to put together, they do not label pieces but they do give the measurements of each piece so it was helpful to have a measuring tape when assembling. Followed directions step by step while looking at a picture of the cat tree. House on top was not nailed together all the way so I nailed it shut myself. Top platform, 2 of the screw holes did not line up with poles, but because top house is heavy enough, and 2 of the 4 screws are in, it is on there good enough. Cat tree is heavy once assembled, and pretty sturdy as well. My cats do not have front claws and they climb all over this well.\\n"

Even undoing the wrong parts and redoing them properly, I still managed to put the whole thing together in about 35 minutes. Two people could probably tackle this in less than twenty. It looks nice (I didn\\'t use the \"vines\" as my cats are chewers) and my cats adore it. Even my heavier cat (currently 14.5 lbs) regularly uses the higher side shelf to peer outside at the birds. Neither cat seems interested in the upper tube and I may end up removing that eventually as it has no structural necessity (I\\'d recommend leaving the lower tube in place regardless, just cause it helps the cats get from the middle platform to the lower side shelf). I would definitely order this again and have already recommended it to everyone I know with cats, but no cat tree.\\n"

I settled on this one because of the price, the color matched our furninture in our second bedroom (I did not see any that accented the brown w/ the black, which is a really nice touch), the wife said it had to have a hammock (this is where George sleeps the most, so she was right :), and the size (74\" was easily a foot or two higher than what many other cat trees are going for at ther same price). The cat tree arrived in two days, everything was in good condition and no pieces were missing. Now thinking this was too good to be true I figured it would be a pain to put together. I have spent some time remodeling homes and have put my fair share of new furniture together, and I will say this was not only the easiest, it ACTUALLY made sense on how you put it together!

                  "review": "\\n  I really love this cat tree! I did a ton of research and ALMOST went with other products. I was looking for a tall cat tower with platforms and hiding spots and scratching posts. I found some similar ones that were even cheaper but every time I read the reviews they weren&#8217;t that great. I read a review where someone recommended Go Pet Club towers and so I started looking and found this one. It was a median price to ones from other brands, but this one had excellent reviews so I took a chance. It came with all the pieces and screws. The reason I give it 4 stars is because we had a bit of trouble reading the directions. It&#8217;s just pictures, and while it&#8217;s fairly simple to see, we had to take the bridge down twice because we put the arches the wrong way. The screws that go into to top tunnel are super short, and just barely fit in so it makes the top tunnel super wobbly. Hasn&#8217;t fell yet, but my 12lb cat might break it one day. I see other people saying the vines don&#8217;t really attach, but on mine i included a pic of the holes at the end of one of them. The other side of the vine was solid and they went together perfect and then I just put some green floral tape around it to seal it. Worked for me. Hope that helps others! All in all, other than the short screw for the top tunnel I really love this and so does my cat! Worth the money for sure!\\n"

As the photos show he was eager to help put it together, it is where we keep his food so our dogs don\\'t eat it, and he loves perching up at the top and overlooking everything. Especially if it gives him a chance to tease the dogs. He likes to start playing with the dogs then go up there and watch them when he is finished because he knows they can\\'t get him. The greenery is nice too, but we only put one strand up at a time because he likes to play with that too and tear it apart!!! There are ample scratching posts and thankfully that is all he uses to sharpen his claws. This is also much sturdier than I had thought it would be based on the price. It\\'s a great price for what you get because some cruddy cat habitats can cost a fortune. Thankfully this is a great sturdy one that didn\\'t cost an arm and a leg. I am sure this will last Archer for as many years as he will use it.\\n"

Very much like the two tone and especially the added silk green vine, love that!<br/>Did use a staple gun to hold the vine in place better, but used it on the poles with carpet not the poles that he uses to scratch [except one in the back].  He loves his activity corner in the TV area!  He has six levels, made him a mosh box with a chaise lounge on top.  This is right by a window which is his TV watching the birds.  Fit perfectly in an area that was open for use.  I literally spent hours on Amazon and other web sites searching for the right one for my cat.  This is made well, large heavy bolts, metal inserts in the legs for sturdy grip.  When assembled 74\\'\\' it does move a little at the top but that builds his core muscles.  The base is large it will not tip over.  So happy to have found this one!\\n"

As other reviewers have mentioned, the different levels can be a bit tricky to get down from since they don\\'t stick out very far, but the cat hasn\\'t had too much trouble with it.

It came with all the necessary tools and pieces but however mine were not labeled (a,b,c,d, etc..) so when reading the instructions I had to pull up the picture and piece it together that way.. but that was not an issue.

                  "review": "\\n  I was impressed by this cat tree when I got it. It was very simple to put together. All of the pieces were there. My cats Phil and Lil are 12-lbs and play very aggressive. I was worried about a tree not being big enough for them to play on. Thankfully this tree is very sturdy with minimal wobbling (only wobbles when they are on the top hanging halfway off it it) It is pretty large as well and they have no problem fitting on any of the platforms. They even fit in the pouch-like bed just fine. It\\'s Lillian\\'s favorite spot. They love to hide in the bottom house and attack each other. The house was a lot bigger then I expected. My Jack Russel Terrier mix fits in just fine as you can see in the pictures and he weighs 22-lbs. Overall I was very happy with the quality and mobility my cats had to move around on it. Its been two weeks and everything is still in perfect condition besides the poor toy that hangs from the top. They easily pulled that off and the string was easily removed to avoid a choking hazard. I would recommend this tree to everyone I know. Its a great price for the quality. P.S. Hair vacuums off of the faux fur without any hassle.\\n"

It\\'s like he\\'s 5 years younger. That itself is worth it. My other cat loves it too, but he is not a big fan of heights.<br/><br/>The leaves are a cute addition, though the ones I got more resemble pot leaves than anything else.

I think I finally found something my more anxious cat can enjoy and get something out of, or at least have a place where he can get away from everyone else.\\n"

Plus the condo is bottom-heavy so that when my bigger cat throttles himself at it the condo is less likely to fall over.<br/><br/>I\\'ve also received a ton of compliments on it from non-cat owners in regards to the design and aesthetics. The condo itself goes great with my decor and the green foliage frills give it that extra little touch that makes it look more like a decorative playground in the living room rather than JUST a cat condo. It actually looks like it belongs with the rest of the furniture.<br/><br/>The thing is VERY heavy. So it\\'s best to build it where you plan on placing it because once it\\'s there it\\'s going to be a cumbersome pain in the neck trying to relocate it.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  ************UPDATED REVIEW***********<br/>DO NOT BUY THIS CAT TOWER! THIS CAT TOWER IS HORRIBLY DESIGNED AND VERY DANGEROUS! DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME! When I got this tower, there was only one bad review but I should have listened to the person who gave the bad review. Everything and I mean everything that happened to their cat tower happened to me.<br/><br/>THE TOP LEFT HALF OF THE TOWER BROKE OFF WITH MY SMALL CAT LAYING IN IT, HURTING MY CAT! The tower had been leaning for months, not even a month after I got it and I should have taken the pieces off months ago. Just yesterday, my very small cat Kurt was sitting in the top bowl and it completely snapped off. My cat fell and was limping for a while and has been too scared to use it since we fixed it and tied with rope to make sure it is sturdy. When it broke I noticed that the sisal post below the top basket is almost completely cardboard except for a small 1 inch plastic piece on the bottom and top (stapled into the cardboard) that you screw/turn to put the other pieces apart. My boyfriend crazy glued this one inch plastic piece into the bottom of the cardboard sisal post and screwed it back into the tower and tied the whole top half of the tower to the bottom part of the tower to keep it from leaning. Before my cat fell, the whole top half of the tower (the top cat bowl and the little cat bed above it) had been leaning for months like the leaning tower of Pisa and I had also tried tying it down to keep it straight and stable. This isn\\'t the only faulty horrible design wrong with the tower.<br/><br/>THE TOWER IS HELD TOGETHER IN MANY PLACES BY DANGEROUS STAPLES!<br/>The entire tower is horribly made. The whole tower is pretty much held together by staples. The rim of the very top cat bed on the left side of the tower came of when I touched it and I noticed the whole thing was attached by staples! A lot of the other pieces are held in by staples and I\\'ve had to remove some after they began coming out and posed a safety risk for my cats.<br/><br/>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY GO PET CLUB AND HORRIBLE CAT TOWER DESIGN!<br/>When I initially got the tower it came with everything but one piece. I contacted amazon who told me that I would have to take apart and send the whole tower again so instead I took a discount and ordered the missing piece from the manufacturer. I notified the manufacturer and they would not give me the piece for free since I bought it through amazon so I had to pay for it. Well I paid for the new sisal post and it came broken. I should have known then that this tower was horribly designed and a safety risk for my cats. I opened the box and when I went to put the sisal post on the tower it snapped in my hand. I noticed that the inside cardboard was completely soaked through (which was unnoticeable when touching the outside of the sisal post) and had to get the company to email me another replacement piece (for no extra charge). I am so thankful that this thing broke in my hands rather than when my cat was on it and get injured. If a sisal post breaks on you you\\'ll notice that the entire thing is made out of CARDBOARD with one inch of plastic stapled in to the bottom and top (not through the whole sisal post to make it stable, which would be the smart safe way to make it) that you screw the other pieces into.<br/><br/>If you see the attached pictures, you can see how after my boyfriend glued the piece that broke (the sisal post below the top cat bowl) we decided to tie the rope/string/ribbon to hold up the leaning tower of pisa (from the sisal post below the top cat bowl to the very top cat bed) by tying the top half of the tower to the bottom of the tower to keep it form leaning and falling over.<br/><br/>I also have included a picture of one of my cats Kurt who always uses this bowl so you can see how small he is. He is not even a year old and the tower started leaning and fell over with him in it. He is very small and thin and he is not even a year old so this should not have even been a problem.<br/>***************Old Review***********************<br/>My cat loves this. She especially loves the bowls, the house on the top and the very top. I rarely saw her the first month we got this because she was always on it. My cat ripped off the mouse on the first day, so I would not expect that to last.<br/>Unfortunately, it came missing a piece. Since I had already started assembling it, amazon offered me a discount so I was able to purchase the missing piece on go pet club.\\n"

But my kitty is 11 months old and about 7-8 pounds and loves this tree. She loves to jump off the recliner and land right on the top posts, gripping it like a koala. She also loves to nap in the hammock and perch on the top platform to watch all of us. I looked into a lot of trees before choosing this one and I was nervous, but I am so glad I got it.\\n"

Also when I tap the 2nd highest platform she jumps onto it and comes to nose kiss me.<br/><br/>The leaves lasted about 5 minutes before they got shredded. If you really want to keep the \"leafy\" look I would suggest looking for some steel wire type leaves to replace them.<br/><br/>Location is key to whether or not your cat uses the tree often.

The platforms are not wobbly like the trees you can pick up pre-built at Petco since each section is screwed in tightly.  The topmost platform is a little shaky, but that is because this tree is considerably tall.  I wish my pictures could do justice for how tall this tree actually is in person (over 6 feet tall).  I am baffled that I found a cat tree with these features for only $100.  Every cat that I have owned never showed interest in hammock styled platforms for trees.  But my kitties chill on it like it ain\\'t no thing.  I can\\'t give a more positive review for this tree.  If you have room in your house, please invest in this tree.  Your fur babies will love it!\\n"

We actually shopped at PetBlah and could only find a very small cat tree for the price of this.  I was actually a little skeptical because of the reasonable price and was pleasantly surprised.  The materials are very nice, it has some good heft to it (highly unlikely to tip) and was very easy to assemble.  Nicely done!  Obviously, the real test is if the cat likes it or not and she loves it!\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  First, I knew this wasn\\'t a heavy duty cat tree from reviews I read, but the price was right for what you got.<br/><br/>It was fairly easy to build. It took about an hour. I wasn\\'t able to complete the last tower since the kit was a bolt short. All of the hardware fell out of the plastic bag during shipment. Unfortunately, there was a hole in the bottom of the first box -- looked as though somebody dragged the box instead of carrying it. The first box is quite heavy, and yes, there is a second box. Anyway, the bolt must have fallen out of the hole.<br/><br/>I contacted Go Pet Club and they were happy to send me a replacement. Unfortunately, the bolt wasn\\'t in the envelope I received-- there was a hole in it too! Go Pet Club sent me another bolt, which I did receive.<br/><br/>The particle board used in this cat tree is not very strong, but it should hold up for cat use. One of the steps to the upper house snapped in half as I pressed it into position. A little gorilla glue fix that. The posts are segmented and hollow with plastic caps at each end. They are attached using the aforementioned bolts. I tightened them as best I could but I was always fearful of stripping the threads.<br/><br/>The two cats pod and the two beds/flats are, in my opinion, are too small unless you have a munchkin. When one of my cats curls up in the top pod, the whole post assembly leans. Now this particular cat is a bit heavy, about 18 pounds so some sagging is to be expected. The hammocks are great.  The cats love them. Another of my cats now lives in the bottom house. The faux fur is rather thin and I expect that it will easily wear out.<br/><br/>So here\\'s the bottom line.  I got what I expected, the cats love it, but I don\\'t think it will stand the test of time, and then I\\'ll have to get another cat tree/condo.\\n"

Our two cats are now hanging out together in the living room together and having so much fun on the tree. Even though I personally love this cat tree, it might not be for everyone, so here are some pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Such great value for the price. You get never get such a large cat tree for this price in pet store.<br/>+ Our cats love the features of this tree. Only thing they haven&#8217;t used much is the cubby on the bottom.<br/>+ Easy and fast to put together.<br/>+ Sturdy. Can be a tiny bit wobbly when cats are on top level, but have never been worried about it even possibly falling down.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Not ideal for large cats. We have an 8 and 10lb cat, and our 10lb cat mostly uses this for playing as he is kinda big to sleep anywhere on the tree. Our 8lb cat loves sleeping on this, especially in the pouch.<br/>- Is larger then it looks, which I guess can be a pro or a con depending on your space. We had to put this on the middle of your living room as it didn&#8217;t fit well in any corners.\\n"

This has discouraged them from playing much on it.  They do like the rope, I am considering buying some rope to cover the pole pieces that do not have rope so they can jump up and be able to grab a hold, they can not grab the poles that are covered in the carpet.  (the carpet is very soft and nice).  They do not use the little \"cubby hole\" it sits on a small round pedestal and is very wobbly.  I am thinking of ways I can alter this so they can use that part.  I have seen one kitty in the little half pipe, they like that.  Overall, it is just OK, easy to put together, they love the hammock, but only one kitty at a time will fit.

We added a small blanket on the windowsill draping down a bit to protect the wall a little bit (they sometimes want to \"slide\" down the wall to the platforms on the way down).<br/><br/>We\\'re really happy with this piece of cat furniture; it does not look out of place at all in our room.\\n"

My one cat wouldn\\'t go on it at all due to it being so shaky, my other cat went all the way to the top and didn\\'t care. I think this would be ok for small cats (under 8lbs). The part to the left with the cubbie and rounded platform were so wiggly though. This could be avoided by having 2 poles under the cubbie and one under the rounded platform. It is basically held together by a small screw at the top of the rounded platform into the top black platform and the bottom pole is connected to the bottom platform. More poles/structure would make this actually a great cat tower. Also, this sissle rope was not the quality my other Go Pet Club tree was. It was coming apart after less than 2 weeks. I had to end up returning it due to the quality and structure.\\n"

She has jumped on it out of it and really gone crazy and it\\'s sturdy minus a few wiggles lol. But really this was a great product for the price and it looks amazing! It really sits well with the rest of the house.  Great product.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  Very cute. Must say, it is much more attractive than I thought it would be. It is quite large though, so consider the base size before committing, as you might be giving up an entire wall in your home.<br/><br/>As for the product itself, it came disassembled with a small wrench for tightening screws. Fairly easy to assemble, though one of the screws in the scoop-looking piece, which attaches to the larger flat black piece only holds the top of the piece (scoop piece)  if it is faced up (not down, with the flathead flush with the walking surface. This makes for a small pointy object sticking up out of an area the cats might lay down. Not well thought through in terms of mechanics.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- East to put together<br/>- Attractive<br/>- Somewhat reasonably priced (see comment below)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- The screw issue, as noted before<br/>- The material isn\\'t durable (very thin and likely to wear out within a year, which means replacing the whole thing)<br/>- The material wasn\\'t attached well, as my cat attempted to scratch one of the brown fuzzy posts and it peeled right off (hardly any glue holding it on and it\\'s paper thin)<br/>- It isn\\'t particularly sturdy; it wobbles. I read that here and thus tightened the screws extra tight, but alas, it\\'s just not solid (think cheap IKEA particle board).<br/><br/>Overall, I\\'d say that if you want a well-made and durable cat condo/tree, you may want to go with a carpet covered one and not purchase this brand. Further, the wobbly nature of the tree means one of my cats refuses to get on it and the other is always nervous while on it (she meows at me as a request to get her down).<br/><br/>In terms of cost/value, I\\'m of mixed feelings: Costco sells really durable cat condos with carpet that last years (at least mine lasted 7 years and probably will continue on past that with its new owner) and this thing will likely last about a year with two older cats (i.e. they aren\\'t rough or destructive) because it simply falls apart.<br/><br/>Is it a good deal? Well, it is certainly attractive (pro for me). It probably won\\'t last very long, as an entire piece of fabric coming off in the first two days due to the cat scratching doesn\\'t bode well for it in the long-term. I really don\\'t think you should ever need to glue pieces back on to a cat tree, let alone off the bat.<br/><br/>All in all, I\\'ll keep it because it\\'s together and I think it\\'s pretty. However, if I were attempting to make a decision about purchasing a quality cat condo/tree, this certainly wouldn\\'t be it.\\n"

The carpet is very soft and cleans up easily, it seems to be well made, plus there is plenty of rope on the posts to scratch their nails on.  The greenery was pretty, but my cats chewed it apart and ate the plastic stems (OH NO!) and now I just have a pile of plastic leaves.  It is for smaller cats.  My kitten and small younger cat love to race up and down the tree, they utilize every level (even the very top) with the exception of the box, no one seems to go in there.  I did have to put weights on the bottom of the tree, probably 60 lbs of hand weights are on the bottom to keep it stable.  Without the add\\'l weights it would tip over, no doubt, the way the cats run up and down.  Even with 60lbs it still sways a little but I don\\'t think it will fall over.  My two larger (12lb &amp; 23lb) cats have no interest, they just don\\'t fit on the shelves and the instability scares them a little.  My kitten loves the little basket which is velvety soft, but she will outgrow it one day, it\\'s small.  I LOVE this cat tree and would highly recommend it if you have smaller cats/kittens. It\\'s well made, just be sure to add weight to the bottom to keep it upright.\\n"

                  "review": "\\n  Updated August 2014:<br/><br/>I initially gave this three stars, but after living with it for a few months I learned that even two stars is probably a generous rating. My cats loved it, but the quality of this thing REALLY sucks. There are numerous options for scratching in our home so this tree didn\\'t get more than a few tugs each time one of the cats jumped onto it. Nevertheless, within weeks long strands and chunks of the sisal were ripping off and settling all over the floor and the platforms below. It was completely unraveled within 3 months, and the felt at the top &amp; bottom of the posts - above and below where the sisal used to be - ended up totally shredded as well.<br/><br/>It\\'s wobbly no matter how much you tighten the bolts, so I had to wedge it into a corner and anchor it to the wall. Even then the bolts in the platforms somehow seemed to loosen over time and I had to tighten them occasionally.<br/><br/>The felt covering grabs every iota of fur, dust and lint that blows anywhere near it, so I found myself vacuuming and lint-rolling the platforms constantly. Despite my best efforts it still took on a very unpleasant musty odor after a few months.<br/><br/>We moved across the country in June, and that thing did NOT come with us; it went straight into the dumpster. I purchased different products of much better quality for our new place, and I couldn\\'t be happier with them. Sure they cost more up front, but I\\'ll come out ahead in the long run because I won\\'t have to replace them a few months from now!<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Based on the 5-star reviews here (and the raves on Wayfair.com), I had high hopes for this tree. So far I\\'m a bit disappointed. Order processing was quick, it shipped out as promised and arrived at my front door within 2 days. So far, so good...until I opened the box.<br/><br/>As I removed all the platforms and pieces I discovered that the faux fur material on this thing sheds. A lot. Assembling it was easy (I managed to put it together by myself in under 30 minutes) but by the time I finished it there were fuzzy bits EVERYWHERE. After using a Swiffer cloth to wipe up as much as I could from the floor and furniture, I got out my Miele and used the brush attachment to vacuum off all the loose bits that were clinging to the posts and platforms. It helped temporarily, but for the past few days that we\\'ve had the tree I\\'ve been chasing floating bits of fuzz &amp; fur all over the house.<br/><br/>I\\'m also disappointed at how unbelievably thin/flimsy the material is on this thing. I was expecting something a little bit cozier/cushier, but the platforms are no softer than our wood floors so I don\\'t see how they would be very comfortable for the kitties. The quality of the sisal covering on the scratching posts isn\\'t any better - little bits unravel and fall off every time one of the cats digs into it. The mouse that hangs from the top platform is cute, but the flimsy string attaching it didn\\'t last more than 60 seconds - one good swipe and the mouse was on the floor.<br/><br/>I didn\\'t bother draping the fake leaves over it. I\\'m sure they\\'d look cute, but my girls have a tendency to chew their way through plastic and I don\\'t want them ingesting some synthetic, chemical-laden crap that was probably made in China.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the base of this tree is wider than some of the other tall ones I\\'ve seen. It\\'s still a little wobbly if the cats are jumping around on it, but securing it to the wall will take care of that.<br/><br/>Overall I\\'m not very happy with the quality, but it\\'ll do for now. I\\'m just glad it wasn\\'t a huge investment - if it lasts for 6 months I\\'ll consider it to be a worthwhile purchase.\\n"

We made our first purchase on the 9th, however the shipment arrived and we were missing half of our tree. We contacted Amazon support and they recommended a return and a repurchase. Alas, the second order arrived with the half we were missing the first time around. When I contacted Amazon for a 3rd time on the 19th, they said they would issue a refund and send a 3rd replacement. They ALSO said they would take the item down to make sure everyone else avoids the rampant issues with the shipping of this item [which they have not]. I would advise not purchasing this item until the distribution/shipping items have been taken care of.<br/><br/>What I believe is happening is this: I think there is an issue between the distribution center and the amazon page. The cat tree is obviously very large... it is supposed to come with at least two packages. Each time we have ordered they have sworn that it was to arrive in one single shipment and box. So, the website needs to either reflect this or customers need to have better information. Either way it has been entirely frustrating... it was supposed to be a valentines day gift.<br/><br/>Believe me, we would LOVE to have the whole product... eventually. I will update once we have the whole product.<br/><br/>[Update 2-21-14 - The 3rd shipment arrived. It is wrong AGAIN. One box, with half the parts. At least some other review-ers got their entire product.]<br/><br/>[Update 5-2-14 - We never ended up getting our full tree. No one knew what they were talking about when we called. Amazon even said they would make the product unavailable until they could sort out the issues. Guess what is still available for other people to purchase and have a hard time with?!]\\n"

We have had the boys since they were kittens. The other two are street-finds effectuated by my son in Nashville. The female is six years old. He kept the male. We have had her for a little over six months. Moving to Florida disrupted life for them and the others of his brood were keeping her from the food plate. She\\'s mine NOW! The other is a find that his girl friend found outside her house in the street. He is two, but we took him right away. I have seen many Turkish vans in my life; this one comes without papers,  but is still the real thing.<br/>In any event, the tree went up easily in our retirement home in Florida. What surprised me was that the young lady of the bunch, made the hammock hers immediately. The huge fuzzy ground cat, went to live in the box at the bottom. Jack, the Turkish van, scampers up the side of the tree and makes the top post his look-out. It is MUCH more sturdy than the reviews I read here. Of course, the rope was going to go. None of our cats have had their claws removed just in case they ACCIDENTALLY get outside. I will NOT take their weapons away. This neighborhood is built in a part of Pasco County, Florida where there are feral cats on the move through our neighborhood all night long. The boys and the girl are here to stay ... inside. The tree is a very good buy for the money. I am about to order another one for our family room.\\n"

My cat used the little cave when it wasn\\'t attached but now that\\'s it is apart of the condo he won\\'t go in; but that might just be preference. The scratching posts are great but the only downside I have about this is the weird angles.
