                  "review": "\\n  I\\'m usually lazy about reviews but am writing in hopes of helping more products like this flourish in the market, because we really need more of this stuff. My dislike of carpet and faux fur limits my options greatly, and this cat tree is a godsend.<br/><br/>- The gray slate wood is lovely and looks better than most human furniture in my house. Not only is it beautiful, but it\\'s also more affordable than most other carpet-free cat trees that are simpler in design. For the price, this is an incredibly high quality piece of furniture to spoil your cat with, and even comes with a full sized screwdriver and easy-to-follow IKEA-style instructions.<br/><br/>- Unlike most cat trees that have open top perches, the rounded and walled top perch on this cat tree allows my cat to curl up and lean safely. The hanging toy is a bonus that allows the lazy cat to become a little more active.<br/><br/>- Kudos for the little pad you can velcro onto the wood surface so the cat doesn\\'t get cold while we still get pleasing aesthetics. The fabric has the pleasant feel of flannel pajamas.<br/><br/>- The bottom box is quite low, and comes equipped with a thick, fluffy cushion - perfect for an aching senior cat. Bonus points for the cushion being removable.<br/><br/>- The proportions are well balanced; minimal lines, tucks nicely against your wall or corner, offers plenty of height without being overwhelming, while packing very diverse resting areas -- a safe little nest to snuggle in, an open space to groom and lounge, and a top perch to curl up or bird watch. It meets all my cat\\'s needs and she stopped using any other bedding.<br/><br/>- Each resting surface (top perch, velcro pad, box) fits a petite cat with a bit of room to spare. For our 8lb cat this is a deluxe condo with plenty of surface area, but if your cat is 22lb, it\\'s gonna be a tighter fit.<br/><br/>- One of the side boards to the enclosed box came with a deep crack that threatened to break off the entire length of the box. We stabilized it by putting the other parts together and fastening them to hold it in place. But if not for this workaround, we would have had to go through the hassle of a return process after having spent half an hour dealing with the assembly, and the frustration would have dampened our spirits about this considerably.<br/><br/>- Some of the holes for the screws were not uniform.<br/><br/>- Due to its many parts, it\\'s inevitably less stable than a solid piece of furniture. The highest perch, for example, wobbles a bit when my cat moves.\\n"

I was able to assemble it relatively quickly, and I am not talented in putting things together at all. I actually got a few things wrong at first, and was still able to get it all put together in about an hour. It\\'s sturdy, doesn\\'t wobble at all when she hops onto or climbs it (and yes she has climbed the scratching post a few times), and the dangle toy is still intact! So far, she hasn\\'t used the cubby yet, aside from poking her head in at first exploration, but it takes her a bit to take to enclosed places.<br/><br/>Overall, a very nice looking cat tree/condo if you\\'re looking for something of a more reasonable height and have a single cat.\\n"

My kitty is declawed so she doesn\\'t use the scratching posts. She is 13-14 pounds and it is sturdy. She loves the toy it came with (there is an extra one included which is nice).

                  "review": "\\n  Absolutely love this cat tower! Wanted to buy something a little shorter to be placed in front of a window for my cats to people watch. They took to it really quickly and have really loved sun bathing on it during the day. I think it&#8217;s a great size overall to give them plenty of space. It&#8217;s very ascetically pleasing which I love compared to a lot of other towers. The one thing I would say for construction- the piece of the cubby with the hole for them to get in (at least for me) was cut so that it had to be put in a specific way to fall flush with the rest. It&#8217;s a square piece but I guess not technically even. I don&#8217;t think it was mentioned in the instructions there was a certain way to slide it so then I just realized that turning it and putting it in differently was what to do. So not a big deal at all but just something to know if putting your piece in the first time makes it not fall flush.\\n"

The height is perfect for my window which is 40&#8221; from the floor. She also uses the scratching posts regularly. I like that it isn&#8217;t made of carpet. The base  and top perch are made of fabric but won&#8217;t leave carpet fibers all over. The cushion for the cubby hole is a little flat so I just put in a blankie on top of it to make it softer. Happy cat. And isn&#8217;t that all that really matters?\\n"

Its very sturdy and well made. One caveat is that the back support on the top seat was a little bent in; from the way it was packaged; but not enough to warrant returning it and really not that noticeable. Its cardboard or something else like that. They probably figured anything else might crack in the shipping. The best thing is that this fits in my small kitchen and Sparkles my 5lb. kitty can stay out from underfoot. Last but certainly not least is that the minute she saw it she climbed into the \"box\". She sat there awhile and then jumped up and inspected the rest. She tried out the toy and presently is \"perched\" up top. She was  watching but is now sleeping from up there as we eat dinner. She immediately took to it and so did we! Not too small or too big. Just the right size and she has plenty of room to grow and it will still accommodate her!<br/>P.S. Update...The backrest I spoke about is covered with fabric and the \"bend is slowly coming out over time. She absolutely loves the top perch and would spend the entire day sleeping up there if she didn\\'t need to come down for food, water or the litter box. Btw the other day I was about 6 feet away and on the phone and she rolled over in her sleep and fell off the perch backwards and hit the floor before I could catch her. She was dazed but fine. I just wish there was a \"safety net or bar\" across the open side of the perch. So I\\'m glad that this cat \"tree\" is no taller than it is. Height is something to think about when you buy one of these :)\\n"

He loves running up and down it when he is playful, and sleeps on the bed at the top. So far he isn&#8217;t very into the enclosed box but I&#8217;ll try to get him into it with treats and toys.
